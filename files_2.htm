                        What accounts for the emergence of particular technologies? Why do they appear when they do? What sort of forces generate them? How is the choice of technology exercised? To put it more concretely, why were digital computers developed only during the second half of the twentieth century even though their basic principles were understood more than a hundred years earlier? Why did photography undergo rapid development during the nineteenth century? What were the inventors of radio trying to accomplish, and how did their intentions differ from those of subsequent developers? These are some of the questions that this chapter will address as it considers some of the most basic issues in the study of technology.

                        As a starting point, it is important to keep in mind that technological change does not take place in a social vacuum. Technology is a human creation, and because humans are social creatures, technological change is necessarily a social process. In recent years, the study of technological change has been strongly influenced by a perspective known as "social constructivism," which we looked at in Chapter 1.According to this approach, technological change does not occur because new devices and processes demonstrate their clear-cut superiority over other ways of doing things. For social constructivists, the analysis has to begin with the need to explain why certain technologies are assumed to work better than others. As Wiebe E. Bijker has noted, social constructivism is predicated on a belief in "the malleability of technology, the possibility for choice, the basic insight that things could have been otherwise." To explain why things turned out the way they did, social constructivists describe how social structures and processes have affected choices of technologies. Since the presence of interest groups and unequal distributions of power are fundamental aspects of every society, social constructivists are particularly interested in delineating the main actors involved in the development and selection of particular technologies, and in noting how their actions reflect their positions in society. Accordingly, for scholarly practitioners of social constructivism, technological change is an inherently political process. New technologies do not succeed or fail solely on the basis of narrow technical merits. Rather, the achievement of technological "closure" (the point at which a particular technology is recognized as the accepted way of doing things, while others disappear or are marginalized) is closely tied to the presence of specific interest groups and their ability to affect the selection process.

                        Some form of social constructivism informs most contemporary studies of technological change, but considerable variation can be found in the relative emphasis put on social versus technical factors. Moreover, some students of technological change, most notably Thomas P. Hughes, have argued that the strength of the social constructivist approach may depend on the developmental stage of a particular technology. According to Hughes, social constructivism is most valid when a technology is at an early stage of development. Social, political, and economic forces are likely to exert the greatest influence when several alternative technologies emerge at about the same time. Conversely, once a technology has become well established, it becomes difficult to deviate from the path that has been laid out by technical requirements. For example, at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, motorists could choose between cars with electric, steam, or internal combustion power plants. The triumph of the latter was not simply a matter of technical superiority, but was a reflection of the needs and expectations of the individuals who were the prime purchasers of automobiles. Once automobiles powered by internal combustion engines became well entrenched, the adoption of another type of automobile engine became extraordinarily difficult because the basic elements of our personal transportation infrastructure were firmly in place, everything from the fuel used to the skills necessary for effective repair work. Under these circumstances, technical requirements will prevail.

                        大多数当代技术变革都可以被某种形式的社会建构主义所解释，但是当解释重点放在社会因素或技术因素之上时，这些解释之间的差异则变得很大。此外，一些技术变革领域的学习者，最著名的是托马斯·P·休斯(Thomas P. Hughes)，认为社会建构主义方法的有效性取决于特定技术的具体发展阶段。休斯认为，当技术处于发展的早期阶段时，社会建构主义最有效。当几种替代技术几乎同时出现时，社会、政治和经济力量可能会产生最大的影响。相反，一旦一项技术成熟起来，就很难偏离技术要求所规定的路径。例如，在 19 世纪末和 20 世纪初，驾车者可以在配备电力、蒸汽或内燃机的汽车之间进行选择。后者的胜利不仅仅是技术优势的问题，而是反映了作为汽车主要购买者的个人的需求和期望。一旦由内燃机驱动的汽车变得根深蒂固，采用另一种类型的汽车发动机就变得异常困难，因为我们个人交通基础设施的基本要素已经牢固到位，从使用的燃料到有效维修工作所需的技能，应有尽有。在这种情况下，技术的重要性占主导地位。

                        One benefit of the social constructivist approach is that it challenges the belief that technological change largely stems from the insights and labors of a few supremely talented individuals. Popular histories of technology have often looked to individual genius as the chief source of technological advance; we have all heard or read stories of how the inspired labors of Thomas Edison or the Wright brothers produced epochal inventions that transformed the world. Histories written from this point of view are in essence biographies of great inventors whose brilliance is assumed to be the sole source of technological advance. Other histories of technological advance have remained within this framework but have looked to a different kind of genius as the source of advance. The key players here are not the inventors of new technologies but rather the entrepreneurs who make inventions into commercial successes by taking risks, moving into uncharted territory, and in general doing what hadn't been done before. There have been some individuals who have been both inventor and successful entrepreneur—for example, Edwin Land, the inventor and moving force behind the Polaroid camera—but they have been rare. Entrepreneurs generally take other people's inventions and make them into commercial successes. From this perspective, the key figure in the development of the steel industry is not Henry Bessemer, the co-inventor of the iron-refining furnace that bears his name, but Andrew Carnegie, who laid the commercial and organizational foundations of the industry.

                        社会建构主义方法的一个好处是它挑战了技术变革主要源于少数极有才华的个人的洞察力和劳动的认知。大众技术史常常将个人天才视为技术进步的主要来源。 我们都听说过或读过有关托马斯爱迪生或莱特兄弟的灵感劳动如何产生改变世界的划时代发明的故事。 从这个观点写成的历史本质上是伟大发明家的传记，他们的才华被认为是技术进步的唯一来源。其它技术进步史也同样在这个框架内，但将另一种天才视为进步的源泉。

                        Arriving at a definitive determination of the relative importance of "great men and women" versus "social processes" in shaping the history of technology would require much more space than is available here. It can be noted, however, that an assessment of the relative contributions of the two has to take into account the fact that a great deal of technological change is the result of small, incremental changes. In contrast to the "heroic" approach to the history of technology, these involve the work of largely anonymous inventors, engineers, mechanics, and technicians. Although their individual contributions may seem modest, in aggregate they have been an extremely important source of technological advance.

                        These incremental changes often are the result of a learning process that occurs as a technology is used. Problems are identified and overcome, bugs are worked out, and improvements are made. In many cases, the cumulative results of these efforts are technological advances at least as important as those that stem from fundamental breakthroughs. In industries as different as petroleum refining and building construction, the major source of productivity improvements has been a multitude of small technological improvements that have resulted in large cumulative gains.

                        This process is nicely illustrated by Louis Hunter's narrative of how the impressive development of nineteenth-century steamboats was the result of plodding progress in which invention in the formal sense counted far less than a multitude of minor improvements, adjustments and adaptations. The story of the evolution of steamboat machinery in the end resolves itself in a large part into such seemingly small matters as, for instance, machining a shaft to hundredths instead of sixteenths of an inch, or devising a cylinder packing which would increase the effective pressure a few pounds, or altering the design of a boiler so that cleaning could be accomplished in three hours instead of six and would be necessary only every other instead of every trip. Matters such as these do not get into the historical record, yet they are the stuff of which mechanical progress is made.

                        One can also witness the far-reaching consequences of numerous small improvements in the development of railroad technology. According to one calculation, if the traffic loads borne in 1910 had been carried by railroads employing the technologies of 1870, the additional costs would have amounted to$1.3 billion by the latter date. Fortunately, by 1910 American railroads had benefited from improvements in the size of cars and the power of locomotives, which in turn were the result of steady evolution. And so it goes today. Even though the railroad may be described as a "mature" industry, this pattern of incremental yet substantial technological development continues. American railroads have significantly lowered their costs through the implementation of a series of small improvements: better insulation for electrical components (thereby allowing higher power loads), improved turbochargers and fuel injection systems, higher compression ratios, more efficient motors in cooling radiators, two-speed cooling fans, redesigned air ducts, lower idling speeds, and the substitution of alternators for direct-current generators. By themselves, none of these innovations is terribly significant. But when they are all put together in a modern locomotive, the result is a 10 percent savings in fuel costs, and a gain of 24 percent in the ton-miles of freight carried per gallon of fuel consumed. When it is noted that railroads spend several billion dollars each year for fuel, the consequences of these improvements are all the more impressive.

                        人们还可以从铁路技术发展中的众多小改进见证其所带来的深远影响。根据一项计算，如果 1910 年承担的交通负荷由采用 1870 年技术的铁路承担，那么额外成本将达到 13 亿美元。幸运的是，到 1910 年，美国铁路受益于汽车尺寸和机车功率的改进，而这又是渐进式发展的结果。今天也是这样。尽管铁路可以被称为"成熟"产业，但这种渐进式的技术发展模式仍在继续。美国铁路通过实施一系列小改进显着降低了成本：更好的电气元件绝缘（从而允许更高的功率负载）、改进的涡轮增压器和燃油喷射系统、更高的压缩比、更高效的冷却散热器电机、两高速冷却风扇、重新设计的风道、更低的空转速度以及用交流发电机替代直流发电机。就其本身而言，这些创新都不是特别重要。但是，当它们全部组装在现代机车中时，结果是燃料成本节省了 10%，每消耗一加仑燃料所承载的货物吨英里增加了 24%。当注意到铁路每年花费数十亿美元购买燃料时，这些改进就更加令人印象深刻。

This is a point stressed by Anthony Athos and Richard Pascale in their book about American and Japanese management: "Careful scrutiny reveals that despite the exalted status of 'strategy' in the lexicon of American management, few great successes stem from one bold-stroke strategic thrust. More often, they result from one half-good idea that is improved upon incrementally. These improvements are invariably the result of a lot of 'little people' paying attention to the product, the customer, and the marketplace."

"Research" calls to mind images of cutting-edge work in well-equipped laboratories, where great breakthroughs produce dramatically new technologies. Research can be an exciting, even glamorous activity, and we naturally look to it as the basis of technological progress. It is the source of fundamental change in technology, like the invention of integrated circuits, cloning, and composite materials. Still, this sort of research rarely results in useable products. The realization of the potentialities created by research breakthroughs usually requires a lengthy process of development. Numerous problems have to be resolved, and, equally important, the new material or device has to be put into a form that allows it to be produced at a reasonable cost.

                        A great deal of development work is oriented toward "scaling up"—that is, making the transition from a successful research result to large-scale production. It is one thing to invent a device or process that works under laboratory conditions, and quite another to produce it in an industrial setting where commercial success is the goal. The development of penicillin provides an excellent illustration of the many facets of the scaling-up process. Although the discovery of the bacteria-killing properties of penicillin initiated a major technological breakthrough, the development phase was certainly no less important.

                        Penicillin, a fermentation product of the mold Penicillium notatum, was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, who observed that bacteria were destroyed in a culture that had been accidentally contaminated by the mold. Penicillium cultures grown in small quantities were the basis of laboratory and clinical research, but this process could not yield the large quantities of the drug needed for widespread therapeutic use. Large-scale production of penicillin was eventually done in huge fermentation vats, a process that required the solution of many technical problems. The key step was the development of a submerged fermentation process that allowed the mold to be grown directly in the nutrient medium. The success of this process in turn required a number of other improvements, such as new tank designs with special cooling systems and turbine mixers, which also had to be developed. The use of corn steep liquor (a by-product of corn starch production) as a culture medium increased yields tenfold, but it created a new problem. Penicillin requires air in order to grow, but severe foaming occurred when the culture was aerated. Anti-foaming products therefore had to be developed to alleviate this problem. The extraction of penicillin from the moldy brew in the vats also created problems that were ultimately solved by the use of freeze drying, which was itself scaled up from a process first used to preserve blood plasma. As a result of all of this development work, production of penicillin had reached 650 billion units by the end of World War II, and the cost of a dose was 55 cents instead of the $20 it had beenthree years earlier.

                        青霉素是霉菌 Penicillium notatum 的发酵产物，由亚历山大·弗莱明 (Alexander Fleming) 于 1928 年发现，他观察到细菌在意外被霉菌污染的培养物中被破坏。 少量生长的青霉菌培养物是实验室和临床研究的基础，但该过程无法产生广泛治疗应用所需的大量药物。 青霉素的大规模生产最终是在巨大的发酵罐中完成的，这一过程需要解决许多技术问题。 关键的一步是开发了一种深层发酵工艺，使霉菌能够直接在营养培养基中生长。这一过程的成功反过来又需要许多其他改进，例如具有特殊冷却系统和涡轮混合器的新型储罐设计，这些也必须开发。 使用玉米浆（玉米淀粉生产的副产品）作为培养基可将产量提高十倍，但也带来了新的问题。 青霉素需要空气才能生长，但当培养物通气时会产生大量的泡沫。 因此，必须开发消泡产品来缓解这个问题。 从大桶中发霉的啤酒中提取青霉素也产生了问题，最终通过使用冷冻干燥解决了这个问题，冷冻干燥本身是从最初用于保存血浆的过程中放大的。由于所有这些开发工作，到二战结束时青霉素的产量已达到 6500 亿单位，一剂的成本为 55 美分，而不是三年前的 20 美元。

                        The first chapter noted the importance of thinking of technologies as systems. This point is reinforced by a consideration of how particular technologies develop. Quite often, a technological leap forward takes place because of the availability of complementary technological developments that allow the resolution of fundamental problems. The history of the computer provides a good example of how complementary changes are essential for the translation of an idea into a workable technology. Back in the 1820s Charles Babbage began to develop an "analytical engine" that contained a set of input devices, a processor, a control unit, a memory storage, and an output mechanism—the essential elements of today's computers. But Babbage's computer was operated by an exceedingly complex set of gears, rods, and other mechanical linkages. Although he could draw on the talents of Ada Lovelace, who is often described as the world's first computer programmer, Babbage's ambitions were not fully realized for more than a century, when solid-state electronics, the cathode ray tube, and magnetic storage devices allowed the development of practical computers.

                        第一章指出了将技术视为系统的重要性。 这一点通过对特定技术如何发展的考虑得到加强。 很多时候，技术飞跃的发生是因为可以解决基本问题的互补技术发展的可用性。 计算机的历史提供了一个很好的例子，说明互补的变化对于将想法转化为可行的技术是多么重要。早在 1820 年代，查尔斯·巴贝奇(Charles Babbage)就开始开发一种"分析引擎"，其中包含一组输入设备、一个处理器、一个控制单元、内存存储和一个输出机制——这是当今计算机的基本要素。 但是巴贝奇的计算机是由一组极其复杂的齿轮、杆和其他机械联动装置操作的。虽然他被描述为和世界上第一个计算机程序员艾达·洛夫莱斯(Ada Lovelace)相当的才能，但一个多世纪以来，巴贝奇的野心并未完全实现，直到固态电子产品、阴极射线管和磁存储设备允许实用计算机的发展。

                        Another illustration of the importance of complementary technological changes can be drawn from the history of one of the twentieth century's most important devices, the internal combustion engine. When these engines were first produced during the late nineteenth century, the spark that ignited the air-fuel mixture was timed to occur at the top of the compression stroke. This did not allow a sufficient time for the mixture to be completely ignited, and efficiency consequently suffered. When, after much experimentation, the spark was timed to occur before the piston reached the top of its stroke, the combustion process was greatly improved, and much more power was consequently delivered. Still, early engines were deficient in power because compression ratios were kept low in order to prevent the sudden detonation of the air-fuel mixture and resultant damage to the engine. This problem was solved in part by conducting careful inquiries into the combustion process and by reshaping the combustion chamber and piston crown in ways suggested by this research. But this was not enough. In order to employ higher compression ratios successfully, it was necessary to modify not just the engine but also the fuel it used. In particular, the research of Thomas Midgley and Charles Kettering demonstrated that the addition of tetraethyl lead to gasoline allowed higher compression ratios and a subsequent improvement in both power and economy. It was thus through a combination of cumulative improvements in both the engine and the fuel it burned that the internal combustion engine reached an acceptably high level of efficiency.

                        补充技术变革重要性的另一个例证可以从二十世纪最重要的设备之一——内燃机的历史中得出。 当这些发动机在 19 世纪后期首次生产时，点燃空气燃料混合物的火花定时发生在压缩冲程的顶部。 这使得混合物没有足够的时间完全点燃，因此效率受到影响。 经过大量实验，当活塞到达其冲程顶部之前，火花被定时发生时，燃烧过程得到了极大的改善，从而提供了更多的动力。 尽管如此，早期的发动机仍然缺乏动力，因为压缩比保持在较低水平，以防止空气燃料混合物突然爆炸并导致发动机损坏。通过对燃烧过程进行仔细调查并按照本研究建议的方式重塑燃烧室和活塞顶，部分解决了这个问题。 但是，这还不够。 为了成功地提高压缩比，不仅需要改良发动机，还需要改良所使用的燃料。通过对燃烧过程进行仔细调查并按照本研究建议的方式重塑燃烧室和活塞顶，部分解决了这个问题。 但是，这还不够。 为了成功地采用更高的压缩比，不仅需要修改发动机，还需要修改所使用的燃料。 尤其是 Thomas Midgley 和 Charles Kettering 的研究表明，四乙基的加入导致汽油具有更高的压缩比，随后在动力和经济性方面都有所改善。 因此，通过发动机及其燃烧燃料的累积改进，内燃机达到了可接受的高效率水平。

                        It is important to note that these changes in engine technology did not take place when the internal combustion engine was first invented, but rather during a period when it was already being sold to customers. This illustrates a point made by Nathan Rosenberg: "The idea that an invention reaches a stage of commercial profitability first and is then 'introduced' is, as a matter of fact, simple minded. It is during a (frequently protracted) shakedown period in its early introduction that it becomes obviously worthwhile to bother making the improvements." In effect, consumers at times may be unwitting participants in the beta testing of new products.

                        需要注意的是，发动机技术的这些变化并不是在内燃机首次发明时产生，而是发生在内燃机已经开始销售的时期。 这证明了内森·罗森伯格 (Nathan Rosenberg) 提出的观点："一项发明首先达到商业盈利阶段然后'引入'的想法是经不起实践检验的。 正是在其早期引入的（通常是长期的）调整期期间，费心进行改进显然是值得的。" 实际上，消费者有时可能在不知情的情况下参与了新产品的 Beta 测试。

                        The commercial viability of a new technology may thus stimulate the development of complementary technologies. A bottleneck that restricts the continued development of a particular technology creates strong economic incentives to find new technologies that clear the obstruction. Many obstacles are surmounted through the use of technologies that have been developed for use by a different industry or in a different sector. This can be seen today in the automobile industry, where emissions requirements have necessitated the use of microprocessors and computers for the regulation of spark advance and air-fuel ratios. Thus, a nineteenth-century technology, the four-stroke internal combustion engine, owes its survival to its marriage to a late twentieth-century technology.

                        Technological advance in one area is often stimulated by the emergence of new technologies in different, but related, areas. This process can be seen in the development of nineteenth-century metal-working industries. Although their products differed substantially, the processes employed by these industries were basically the same: turning, boring, drilling, milling, and planing. At the same time, they all confronted similar technical problems of transmitting power, reducing friction, and controlling the rate of feed. This meant that a technological solution arrived at by one industry was often directly applicable to the problems of another industry.This occurred in the early automobile industry, which made abundant use of the products and manufacturing techniques that had been developed by the bicycle industry during the 1880s and 1890s. Ball bearings, spoke wheels, drive chains, and the use of electrical resistance welding had been extensively employed for the manufacture of bicycles in the decades immediately preceding large-scale automobile production. One of the most novel and significant technologies entailed the use of stamped components to take the place of forgings. Their use eliminated a great deal of machining, with a consequent lowering of production costs. The cheap, mass-produced automobile thus owed much to technologies initially developed to make a product that it subsequently eclipsed.

                        一个领域的技术进步往往受到相关领域新技术的刺激。 这一过程可以在 19 世纪金属加工工业的发展中看到。 虽然他们的产品差别很大，但这些行业所采用的过程基本相同：车、镗、钻、铣、刨。 同时，它们都面临着传递动力、减少摩擦、控制进料速度等类似的技术问题。 这意味着一个行业得出的技术解决方案往往直接适用于另一个行业的问题。在早期的汽车工业中，大量利用了自行车工业在 1880 年代和 1890 年代开发的产品和制造技术。 在大规模汽车生产之前的几十年里，滚珠轴承、辐条轮、传动链和电阻焊的使用已广泛用于制造自行车。 最新颖和最重要的技术之一是使用冲压件来代替锻件。 它们的运用消除了大量机械加工，从而降低了生产成本。 因此，廉价、大规模生产的汽车很大程度上归功于最初用于那些被淘汰产品的技术。

                        This is hardly the only example of technologies developed by an established industry paving the way for a radically new one. Although the turbojet engine was a novel method of propulsion when it first appeared in the 1940s, it drew heavily on designs, components, and processes that had already been developed for steam turbines. In Edward Constant's summary, "All the work done on blade design, gas flow, shaft and bearing loads, temperature distribution, lubrication systems, governors, blade-cutting machines, test procedures and instruments, and countless other facets of design and production could be applied to gas turbine development."Interindustry transfers of technology do not happen automatically. The effective transfer of hardware, information, or simply (but importantly) the belief that a problem is solvable requires individuals and organizations that are capable of functioning in both worlds and have the incentives to do so. It also requires that these individuals and organizations are acceptable to the other individuals and organizations with which they interact, and that they are capable of speaking the same technical language. Technological innovation is, in Christopher Freeman's phrase, a "coupling process" that occurs at the interfaces between science, technology, and the market. This does not take place solely through intuitive flashes: "It is a continuous creative dialogue over a long period of research, experimental design, and development."

                        Finally, it should be noted that sometimes the complementary changes necessary for the success of a new technology are not technological. A successful technological change may require changes in basic habits and attitudes. This can be seen in the failure of agricultural extension agents in New Mexico to get farmers to adopt hybrid corn in the late 1940s. There was no question about the technical superiority of the corn: demonstrations showed that its use resulted in a potential trebling of yields. Impressed by this improvement, half of the farmers planted the new variety, thereby immediately doubling their output. But after two years virtually all of the farmers had abandoned hybrid corn and reverted to their traditional low-yielding crop. The problem was that the cornmeal made from the hybrid variety could not be made into good tortillas; it did not taste right and couldn't be easily shaped. In the absence of a change in culinary patterns, a technically superior product could make no lasting impact.

                        最后，应该指出的是，有时新技术成功所必需的补充性变化不是技术性的。成功的技术变革可能需要改变基本习惯和态度。这可以从 1940 年代后期新墨西哥州的农业推广机构未能让农民采用杂交玉米中看出。玉米的技术优势是毋庸置疑的：示范表明，它的使用可能会让产量增加两倍。由于对改进印象深刻，一半的农民种植了新品种，因此他们的产量立即翻了一番。但两年后，几乎所有农民都放弃了杂交玉米，转而使用传统的低产作物。问题是由杂交品种制成的玉米面不能制成好的玉米饼；它味道不对，也不容易成型。在烹饪模式没有改变的情况下，技术上优越的产品不会产生持久的影响。硬件、信息或简单地（但很重要地）认为问题是可以解决的信念的有效转移需要能够在两个世界中运作并有动力这样做的个人和组织。 它还要求这些个人和组织能够被与他们互动的其他个人和组织所接受，并且他们能够说相同的技术语言。 用克里斯托弗·弗里曼的话说，技术创新是一个发生在科学、技术和市场之间的"耦合过程"。 这不仅仅是通过直觉的一闪而过的："这是在长期的研究、实验设计和开发过程中不断进行的创造性对话。"

                        The rejection of hybrid corn in New Mexico demonstrates the perils in the technological determinist perspective, in which technological change is viewed as a largely self-contained process. As we have seen, social constructivists have taken issue with "internalist" histories that ignore the social, economic, and political forces that shape technological change. And as was noted a few pages ago, contemporary scholarship has moved away from the "great person" approach to the history of technology. To be sure, many technologies owe their existence to the inspiration and hard work of individuals, including the unsung heroes who were responsible for the myriad improvements necessary for the realization of a new technology. But surely more is involved than their efforts. After all, human ability is presumably spread evenly throughout cultures and historical epochs, yet significant technological changes are not equally distributed over time and place. Thomas Edison's genius produced 1,093 patents, and some of his inventions transformed the world. Had he been born in ancient Rome or dynastic China, he might have helped to design aqueducts or sections of the Great Wall, but it is unlikely that his talents would have changed the course of Roman or Chinese history. Geniuses require appropriate social settings for the realization of their talents.

                        新墨西哥州对杂交玉米的拒绝表明了技术决定论观点的危险，在这种观点中，技术变革在很大程度上被视为一个独立的过程。 正如我们所见，社会建构主义者对忽视影响技术变革的社会、经济和政治力量的"内在主义"历史提出异议。 正如几页前所指出的，当代学术已经从"伟人"的研究方法转向技术史。 可以肯定的是，许多技术的存在都归功于个人的灵感和辛勤工作，其中包括为实现新技术所必需的无数改进而负责的无名英雄。但肯定的是，个人努力是不够的。 毕竟，人类的能力可能在整个文化和历史时代中平均分布，但重大的技术变化在时间和地点的分布并不均等。 托马斯爱迪生的天才创造了 1093 项专利，他的一些发明改变了世界。 如果他出生在古罗马或中国王朝，他可能会帮助设计渡槽或长城的部分，但他的才能不太可能改变罗马或中国历史的进程。 天才需要适当的社会环境来实现他们的才能。

                        What kind of social system is required if inventive ability is to flourish? Why does technological innovation occur in some places and times and not in others? In beginning to answer these questions, it is helpful to apply to technological change the concepts that have been so useful to economists: supply and demand. Everything from fundamental scientific breakthroughs to minor refinements serves to "push" new technologies into the world. Still, simply having an available supply of new devices and techniques does not guarantee that they will be used. Many examples of technologies that languished because they were "ahead of their time" can be cited. The pneumatic tire was patented in 1845 and then forgotten until it was reinvented by John Dunlop in 1888. DDT was first synthesized in 1874, but it was not put to use as an insecticide until 1941. Several decades elapsed before the laser passed from being a laboratory curiosity to a practical device used for everything from supermarket scanners to instruments for microsurgery.

                        For a technology to make the transition from the potential to the actual requires not just that it exist; there must also be a desire for it, coupled with the ability to pay for it. Economists call this "effective demand." Seen in this light, technology is like any other good or service; it will not be produced unless some person, group, or organization wants it and is willing to buy it. Technology is "pushed" by a variety of forces, but it also has to be "pulled" by effective demand. To understand why certain technologies have flourished while others have languished, it is therefore necessary to consider the configuration of a society and the way in which it determines the effective demand for particular technologies.

By examining a long series of patents in various industries, Schmookler found that their emergence was closely related to the level of demand for the products of these industries. To take one rather obvious example, inventors' interest in improving the horseshoe was strong when the horse was a primary means of transportation, but interest evaporated when the steam engine and the internal combustion engine began to displace it.

                        Another illustration of the importance of demand-inducing technological development can be extracted from the history of photography in the nineteenth century. For centuries painters and scientists had made use of the camera obscura, a darkened room into which light was admitted through a pinhole, resulting in the projection of an inverted image of an outdoor scene on the opposite wall. Later developments substituted optical lenses for the pinhole, which made for a sharper image. Photographs were first produced during the 1820s and 1830s when pioneers such as Niepce, Daguerre, and Fox Talbot devised chemical emulsions that preserved the image on paper or a metal plate. But the rapid growth of photography cannot be attributed simply to the supply of these inventions. At this time, social changes were sweeping across Europe, resulting in the ascendance of a new social elite, the property-owning commercial and industrial bourgeoisie. The members of this group had a keen desire to flaunt their affluence by taking on characteristics of the old aristocracy. For the latter, a key artifact of their status was the painted portrait; we have all seen renditions of persons such as the Eighth Duke of Puddleswallop hanging in our local museums. But many of the rising bourgeoisie lacked the money or the time for such symbols of their importance, and, in any event, there were not enough skilled portrait painters to serve the needs of this growing group of people. Their aspirations were therefore met by the photographic portrait studio, where the subject posed with the trappings of upper-class status, such as rich draperies and elegant furniture. In the later decades of the century, new and cheaper methods of photography emerged to meet the demands of poorer yet increasingly affluent people, such as American immigrants who wanted portraits that could be sent back home. Today, the effective demand produced by a great mass of consumers has stimulated the development of a huge variety of photographic apparatus, ranging from simple disposables to ubiquitous cell phone cameras and sophisticateddigital cameras.

                        Good business practice is often implicitly based on the realization that successful technological development requires the presence of effective demand. One English study found that the key determinant of a firm's innovative success was an understanding of customer requirements. This meant that from its very inception, a new product or process had to be developed with an eye toward meeting the needs of actual or potential customers. Similarly, a Canadian study found that the commercial failure of many inventions was due to an inability to evaluate the true extent of demand. A great deal of product development was done with little consideration of market potential. It was often the case that entrepreneurs were so infatuated with their product innovation that they were incapable of realistically assessing opportunities and the nature of the market.

                        良好的商业实践往往隐含地基于这样一种认识，即成功的技术开发需要有效需求的存在。 一项英国研究发现，公司创新成功的关键决定因素是对客户需求的理解。 这意味着从一开始，新产品或新流程的开发就必须着眼于满足实际或潜在客户的需求。 同样，加拿大的一项研究发现，许多发明的商业失败是由于无法评估需求的真实程度。 大量的产品开发是在很少考虑市场潜力的情况下完成的。 通常情况下，企业家对他们的产品创新如此着迷，以至于他们无法现实地评估机会和市场性质。

                        At the same time, however, gauging the potential demand for a new product can be a tricky task. Many of today's "essential" technologies were not at first recognized as such. When in the late 1930s Chester Carlson attempted to interest established business machine manufacturers in his photocopying device—the first Xerox machine—they were of the uniform opinion that there was no point in employing complicated apparatus and chemicals simply to replace carbon paper. And even inventors can badly misjudge the ultimate consequences of their own creations. Alexander Graham Bell initially thought that the telephone he invented would primarily be used to transmit operas and other musical performances from the concert hall to the home. Edison at first believed that one of the main applications of his phonograph would be to record the last words of dying men. We can also take note of the judgment of Howard Aiken, the director of the team that built one ofthe world's first computers, who in the early 1950s prophesied that in the foreseeable future, the total need for computers in the United States could be met by no more than a half-dozen machines. In similar fashion, before 1950 Thomas J. Watson,the president of IBM, was of the opinion that there would be no commercial market for computers.

                        然而，与此同时，衡量对新产品的潜在需求可能是一项棘手的任务。 今天的许多"基本"技术起初并没有得到认可。 1930 年代后期，切斯特·卡尔森 (Chester Carlson) 试图让老牌商用机器制造商对他的复印设备（第一台施乐机器）感兴趣时，他们一致认为，仅仅使用复杂的设备和化学品来代替复写纸是没有意义的。 甚至发明家也可能严重误判他们自己创造的最终结果。 亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔(Alexander Graham Bell)最初认为他发明的电话主要用于将歌剧和其他音乐表演从音乐厅传送到家庭。爱迪生起初认为留声机的主要用途之一是记录垂死之人的遗言。我们还可以注意到制造世界上第一台计算机的团队主管霍华德·艾肯 (Howard Aiken) 的判断，他在 1950 年代初期预言：在可预见的未来，美国对计算机的总需求不会超过六台。以类似的方式，在 1950 年之前，IBM 总裁 Thomas J. Watson 认为计算机不会有商业市场。

                        The history of radio also shows how a technology may be put to uses not envisaged by its inventors. When equipment for sending and receiving radio waves was first developed during the late nineteenth century, no one imagined that it would be used for commercial broadcasts. The first transmitters and receivers were devised for purely intellectual purposes—in order to test the validity of James Clerk Maxwell's theories about the nature of electromagnetic waves. Only after the passage of more than a decade did some visionaries perceive a commercial use for radio apparatus, and then their imaginations were limited to the use of the radio for ship-to-shore communications. Decades passed before the idea of broadcasting to a mass audience emerged.

                        What are we to make of these examples? They seem to refute the theory that technologies are primarily the result of "demand-pull," for all of the technological developments just described emerged in the absence of apparent demand for them. Perhaps we can salvage the demand-pull theory by distinguishing two different kinds of technological advances. The first kind consists of refinements and improvements to an existing way of doing things, while the second (and far less frequent) is the truly revolutionary breakthrough—the Internet, the digital computer, radio, the telephone, and the like. In cases such as these, the very novelty of a revolutionary breakthrough makes it difficult to determine what its ultimate uses will be and who, if anyone, will want it. By contrast, advances of the first kind occur within a known context; the basic technology is already in use, and there are likely to be people and business firms that want, and are willing to pay for, the new wrinkles that promise to improve an existing technology. Improvements of this sort therefore have a predictable market. Conversely, radically new technologies confront a great deal of uncertainty. They may satisfy a latent need, or they may create a new one. They may also sink without leaving a trace. They are flights into the unknown, and it is hazardous to guess what sort of a reception they will meet. If nothing else, they confirm the old Chinese saying that it is dangerous to make predictions—especially about the future.

                        The forces that "push" and "pull" technological advance do not exist everywhere or in equal measure. In many places and at many times, the distribution of wealth and power retarded these forces, resulting in a slow pace of technological advance. Moreover, the particular technological advances that do occur usually reflect a society's general configuration of wealth and power. In the European Middle Ages, the landowning aristocracy and Church officials controlled most of the wealth and wielded great power. The monastic orders often played an important role in land clearing, farming, and the construction of mechanical devices, but for the most part the religious and secular establishment showed little interest in such matters. While the era gave rise to significant technological advances in water power, mechanical clocks, and weaponry, its most evident technological triumph was the great symbol of the traditional order: the Gothic cathedral.

A market system organized around the principle of private property was of crucial importance for the stimulation and guidance of inventive and innovative abilities, as well as their application to production.

                        In the time of Marx and Engels, and in our own time, a market economy driven by the activities of self-interested businessmen has produced the most receptive environment for technological innovation. There are several reasons for this. A market economy will stimulate inventive efforts, for it promises financial rewards to those able to meet the needs of consumers. For example, somebody invents a better mousetrap in the hope of selling it in the market. If the demand is there, eager customers will buy it. Everybody is better off: consumers have a better mousetrap, while the inventor gets rich and retires to Palm Springs, and nobody worries about how technological advance has lowered the quality of life for mice. Second, a market economy is characterized by the presence of numerous competitors. Under these circumstances, a producer is strongly motivated to develop and apply new technologies in order to make better products and to reduce production costs. Failure to do so may result in the eventual collapse of the enterprise, as the history of many once-successful firms demonstrates. Finally, a market system is particularly effective in eliciting the production of the auxiliary items necessary for technological innovation. A new technology will require special materials, components, and services. Because of its responsiveness to new sources of demand, a market economy is well suited to meet these requirements.

                        在马克思和恩格斯时代，以及在我们这个时代，由利己主义商人活动驱动的市场经济为技术创新创造了最容易接受的环境。 这有几个原因。 市场经济将刺激创造性的努力，因为它承诺对那些能够满足消费者需求的人给予经济回报。 例如，有人发明了更好的捕鼠器，希望能在市场上销售。 如果有需求，热切的客户就会购买。 每个人都过得更好：消费者拥有更好的捕鼠器，而发明者则致富并退休到棕榈泉，没有人担心技术进步如何降低老鼠的生活质量。其次，市场经济的特点是竞争者众多。 在这种情况下，生产者有强烈的动力去开发和应用新技术，以生产更好的产品并降低生产成本。 不这样做可能会导致企业最终倒闭，正如许多曾经成功的公司的历史所证明的那样。 最后，市场体系在促进技术创新所必需的辅助物品的生产方面特别有效。 新技术将需要特殊的材料、组件和服务。 由于其对新的需求来源的响应能力，市场经济非常适合满足这些要求。

                        The advantages of a market economy in stimulating technological advance are further demonstrated by an examination of centrally planned economies. For decades the economies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were organized through the mechanisms of central planning, but during the 1980s it became painfully evident that these mechanisms were fatally flawed. One of the chief manifestations of that failure has been a retarded technology. It cannot be denied that the Soviet Union produced some impressive technological achievements, most notably in its space and military programs, while China made significant progress in industrializing an impoverished country, but taken as a whole their level of technological development remained stagnant while the United States, Western Europe, and Japan moved rapidly forward.

                        The backwardness of centrally planned economies has had significant political repercussions. In China, dissatisfaction with the pace of technological and economic advance led to a retreat from centralized planning and a much greater scope for market-based economic relations, In the Soviet Union, the fear of falling even further behind the West motivated the Gorbachev regime to introduce some elements of a market economy and to attenuate the role of central planning. But these efforts were not enough, and within a few years the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In the countries of the former Soviet Union and in China, it has become evident that market-based reforms have made major contributions to economic and technological development, albeit at the cost of greater economic and social inequality, as the recent histories of the two nations have shown.

                        Many of the difficulties experienced by centrally planned economies in achieving technological advance have been the result of a basic tension between their system of economic management and the requirements of technological innovation. Centrally planned economies rest on the assumption that economic activities can be reduced to predictable routines. But the course of technological innovation is notoriously difficult to predict. The bureaucratic procedures that work tolerably well for the administration of routine productive tasks usually fail when they are applied to technological innovation. A planning agency can set goals and quotas for the production of established goods, and various ministries can oversee the actual operation of individual enterprises through routine bureaucratic administration. But these procedures work much less well when innovation is the goal. Innovation is an activity full of risk and unpredictability, and it cannot easily be accommodated to preprogrammed structures and activities.

                        To make matters worse, centrally planned economies attempt to motivate workers and managers through the allocation of rewards that create disincentives for technological innovation. A factory manager typically receives bonuses for the fulfillment and overfulfillment of quotas for established products, as given by the central plan. The production of an innovative product is not rewarded, for it has not been stipulated by the plan. The uncertainties and unpredictabilities that surround technological innovations create risks for those who seek to develop and use them, but these risks are not matched by commensurate rewards for thosewho take them.

To be sure, we tend to think of technology as the result of efforts to solve problems of this sort; after all, technology has already been defined as the product of knowledge that is used in order to get something done. The very word "technology" conjures up images of useful devices, and technology's practitioners—engineers, managers, and skilled workers—are often viewed as a serious bunch, sitting rigidly in front of computer terminals, making precise measurements, and, above all, applying their talents to the solution of practical problems that are usually tied to economic concerns.

When Willis Whitney served as the first director of the research laboratory of the General Electric Company, he often asked his scientists and technicians there if they were "having fun." For Whitney, "fun" was working on problems that had stumped everyone. Pursuing these problems was nothing less than the most exciting thing that a person could do.

                        Consider, too, one of America's most famous inventors, Benjamin Franklin. With typical American pragmatism he wrote, "Utility is in my opinion the test of value in matters of invention, and that a discovery which can be applied to no use, or is not good for something is good for nothing." Franklin's inquiries into the nature of electricity did result in one useful device: the lightning rod, which saved many a building from destruction. But his other inquiries had a less immediate payoff. Although Franklin devised a number of devices that helped him to learn more about the nature of electricity, decades passed before electricity had any practical value. Indeed, he was "chagrined a little that we have been hitherto able to produce nothing in this way of use to mankind."

                        Later events proved him wrong, although he never shared in that knowledge. Still, the pursuit of useful innovations could not have been the prime motive for Franklin's inquiries. Franklin was an amateur in the literal sense of the word: a person who pursues an activity for the sheer love of it. For many years the leisure-time pursuits of amateur scientists such as Franklin sustained research into the nature of electricity despite the absence of direct applications, yet these "idle" intellectual efforts were essential to the invention of a great variety of useful devices.

                        A century after Franklin died, a young man of seventeen climbed a cherry tree and turned his imagination to possibilities that only a few had dreamed of. The year was 1899, and the young man was Robert Goddard, who was to be the inventor of the liquid-fueled rocket. As he recalled in later years, "It was one of the quiet, colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in October in New England, and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. . . . I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended, for existence at last seemed very purposive." At that time, and for many years to come, Goddard could scarcely have imagined the products of that October vision: orbiting satellites for global communication links, weather prediction, global positioning systems, and the development of terrifying new weapons. Throughout his life Goddard continued to be energized by the dream of space travel for its own sake; practical consequences were at best a secondary concern.

                        It also should be noted that even in a predominantly market-oriented, capitalist society such as the United States, not all technologies have been generated and shaped by market forces. Chapter 18 will take up this issue by examining the role of the government in promoting technological change. At this point it will only be noted that technologies developed outside the constraints of the market system are less likely to be shaped by concerns about costs. Firms operating in a market environment know that minimizing costs is essential to success. Technologies that hold down production costs are quite appealing, as are technologies that expand sales by lowering the cost of the product itself. The Ford Motor Company during the glory years of the Model T is a striking example of a firm that owed its success to the use of new technologies in order to lower costs. This process also has been dramatically demonstrated in recent years as technological advances in the design and production of integrated circuits have led to sharp declines in the price of personal computers and a concomitant expansion of this market. At the same time, however, there are large sectors of the economy where prices and the costs of production are secondary concerns. As a result, the pattern of technological development can be quite different. This has been particularly evident in the defense industry, where the presumed dictates of national security have allowed the deployment of staggeringly expensive military technologies. To take a particularly striking example, a single Air Force F-22 fighter costs U.S. taxpayers $412 million (when R&D and testing costs are taken into account) and requires 30 hours of maintenance and an expenditure of $44,000 for every hour it is in the air. In a climate where only the presumed best will do, there are strong tendencies to "gold plate" weapons systems and to have little concern for cost constraints.

                        还应该指出的是，即使在美国这样的以市场为导向的资本主义社会中，并非所有技术都是由市场力量产生和塑造的。 第 18 章将通过研究政府在促进技术变革中的作用来讨论这个问题。 在这一点上，人们只会注意到，在市场体系约束之外开发的技术不太可能受成本问题的影响。 在市场环境中运营的公司知道，最大限度地降低成本是成功的关键。 降低生产成本的技术非常有吸引力，通过降低产品本身的成本来扩大销售的技术也是如此。

                        This tendency is not confined to the military sector. In recent years there has been a mounting concern about the financial costs of modern medical technologies. Some medical technologies, such as antibiotics, have undoubtedly lowered the costs of medical care, but many others have had the opposite result. When faced with a choice between controlling medical expenses or saving lives and alleviating pain through the use of sophisticated technologies, it is difficult for any individual or society concerned with the well-being of its members to put the former ahead of the latter. It is thus no surprise that about half the growth of health care spending that occurred during the second half of the twentieth century can be attributed to the use of new technologies.

                        The case of military and medical technologies brings us back to the necessity to consider the political and social context of technological choice. Economic considerations, important as they are, are not the sole basis of decisions regarding the development, selection, and use of particular technologies. Nor does technology develop according to its own internal dynamics. Technologies are social creations, and any successful attempt at understanding why particular technologies are created, chosen, and used must take into account their social context. Having made this basic point, we will pursue the matter a bit further by looking at the processes through which technologies spread and take hold. But before we do so, we need to consider one more source of technological change: scientific advance. This will be the topic of the next chapter.

                        Chapter 1 introduced the concept of technological determinism, the idea that technology acts as an independent force in human affairs. As we have seen, this perspective has a number of problems, one of them being that it simply takes technological change as a given and fails to consider how new technologies emerge and diffuse. In the first part of this chapter, we will revisit the concept of technological determinism by noting some of its corollaries and considering their strong and weak points. We will then assess the influence of some of the key actors who are directly involved with the process of technological change. To repeat an earlier assertion, technology is a human creation, but at the same time it should be evident that individual men and women have not participated equally in initiating and directing technological change.

                        For all of its shortcomings, technological determinism still exerts a lot of influence. One of the places where it shows up is in the theory of "cultural lag." Formulated by William F. Ogburn, whom we briefly met in Chapter 1, the theory of cultural lag is predicated on the belief that habits, thoughts, values, and social arrangements often fail to change at the same speed as technological innovation. Technology moves ahead, but many other things lag behind. On the face of it, this seems a reasonable concept, and we should have no difficulty in coming up with a number of examples. To take one, the expansion of public health services and modern medical technologies have lowered infant mortality, but people in some parts of the world continue to have large families, due in part to traditional expectations that many children will not survive infancy. Only after several generations, when expectations and practices have "caught up" with the level of technology, will birth rates begin to fall. To take another example—one that has been the source of considerable conflict, litigation, and governmental legislation—the ease of copying and transferring digitized books and music has profoundly undermined traditional notions of intellectual property and the proper means of accessing it. It can be confidently predicted that many years will go by before the legal system catches up.

                        尽管存在各式各样的缺点，技术决定论依旧展现出很大的影响力。 它的一个衍生就是"文化滞后"理论。 文化滞后理论由我们在第 1 章中提到的 William F. Ogburn 提出，它基于这样一种信念：即习惯、思想、价值观和社会安排的变化速度通常无法与技术创新同步。 技术在进步，但许多其他事物则被抛在身后。 这看起来合情合理，我们应该不难找到一些例子。例如：公共卫生服务和现代医疗技术的发展降低了婴儿死亡率，但世界某些地区的人们仍然拥有大家庭，这其中的部分原因是出于传统认知，即：许多儿童无法活到长大。 只有在几代人之后，当认知和实践"赶上"技术水平时，出生率才会开始下降。 再举一个例子——它一直是相当大的冲突、诉讼和政府立法的根源——复制和传输数字化书籍和音乐的容易程度已经深刻地破坏了传统的知识产权概念和获取它的适当方式。 可以几乎确定，法律体系赶上技术发展还需要很多年。

                        Appealing as it is on the surface, the theory of cultural lag has its shortcomings. In the first place, technological changes are simply taken as givens, and no attempt is made to delineate how they came to be in the first place. Although traditional histories of technology have conveyed the impression that inventions are carried forward largely by their own internal logic and are little influenced by external factors, this perspective leaves a great deal out of the story. As earlier chapters of this book have indicated, many things that are not technical in nature strongly influence the course of technological change. At the risk of repetition, suffice it to say that technology should not be viewed as an independent source of social change.
                    </span>
                    <span class="chi">
                        文化滞后理论虽然表面上很有吸引力，但也有其不足之处。 首先，技术变革被简单地视为既定条件，并没有试图描述它们最初是如何形成的。 尽管传统的技术史给人的印象是，发明主要是由其自身的内在逻辑推动的，很少受外部因素的影响，但这种观点远远不够全面。 正如本书前面的章节所指出的，许多本质上不是技术性的东西会强烈影响技术变革的过程。 为了不重复前面的论点，在此可以说技术不应被视为社会变革的独立来源。

                        Second, many attempts to demonstrate the connection between technological and social changes present us with the problem of measuring and trying to connect different kinds of phenomena. Technological changes can often be more easily measured than sociocultural changes, making it hard to determine the precise connection between the two. We can easily tabulate the increase in the number of automobiles between 1900 and 1925, but to what extent did widespread car ownership contribute to changes in sexual activity during this period? In similar fashion, we can tabulate the number of television shows with violent programming, but, as we have seen in Chapter 13, determining the influence of these programs on individual behavior is fraught with difficulties.
                    </span>
                    <span class="chi">
                        其次，许多证明技术和社会变化之间联系的尝试向我们提出了衡量和尝试连接不同类型现象的问题。 技术变化通常比社会文化变化更容易衡量，因此很难确定两者之间的确切联系。 我们可以很容易地将 1900 年至 1925 年间汽车数量的增加制成表格，但在此期间，普遍拥有汽车在多大程度上促进了性活动的变化？ 以类似的方式，我们可以将带有暴力节目的电视节目的数量制成表格，但是，正如我们在第 13 章中看到的，确定这些节目对个人行为的影响充满了困难。

                        Third, at what point can it be said that a society "catches up" with a given technological innovation? New productive technologies have allowed major alterations in the traditional divisions between "men's work" and "women's work," but customs and social arrangements have not completely taken account of this fact. To be sure, there have been significant changes, but at what point can it be confidently said that a complete accommodation has occurred? Then, too, some technological innovations have been followed by rapid adjustments, while in other cases these adjustments occur slowly, if at all. In regard to the latter, the killing power of modern weaponry far exceeds the spears and stones of our Neolithic ancestors, yet we still engage in warfare as a means of resolving our disputes. Obviously, something other than technology itself is affecting the extent of and speed at which particular cultural lags are eradicated.

                    <span class="chi">
                        第三，什么时候可以界定一个社会"赶上"了某项技术创新？ 新的生产技术令"男人的工作"和"女人的工作"这样的传统划分发生重大变化，但习俗和社会安排并没有完全对应这一现实。 确实，已经发生了重大变化，但在什么时候可以确切地说社会已经完全适应？ 然后，一些技术创新伴随着快速调整，而在其他情况下，这些调整则发生得很慢，如果不是没有的话。 对于后者，现代武器的杀伤力远远超过我们新石器时代先民的枪和石，但我们仍然以战争作为解决争端的手段。 显然，技术本身以外的其他因素正在影响消除特定文化滞后的程度和速度。

                    <span class="eng">
                        Fourth, the theory of cultural lag assumes a unified society and culture, and ignores the economic, political, and cultural divisions to be found in all complex societies. Describing a social phenomenon as an example of cultural lag may therefore be a reflection of the values and preferences of particular groups or individuals.The unwillingness of Amish farmers to use electricity could be labeled an instance of cultural lag, but this assumes that saving labor is a benefit of unquestionable value; those convinced of the sanctity of physical work would not agree.
                    </span>
                    <span class="chi">
                        第四，文化滞后理论假设了一个统一的社会和文化，而忽略了所有复杂社会中存在的经济、政治和文化分歧。 因此，将社会现象描述为文化滞后的一个例子可能反映了特定群体或个人的价值观和偏好。 阿米什的农民不愿意用电可能会被贴上文化滞后的标签，但这假设节省劳动力是一种价值毋庸置疑的好处； 那些认为体力劳动神圣不可侵犯的人不会同意。

                    <span class="eng">
                        Finally, there is a hidden value judgment contained in the concept of cultural lag. Implicit in it is the notion that technology is a progressive, dynamic element in human history, and that social and cultural arrangements are intransigent sources of obstruction. But isn't it possible that a cultural lag may demonstrate the danger or inappropriateness of a particular technological innovation? Once again it might be noted that just because something is technically possible, it does not necessarily follow that it should be done, or that people should submit to it and make the necessary alterations to their lives. We now have the capability to implant a fertilized ovum into a surrogate mother, who then carries and delivers the baby. Should we replace old-fashioned methods of reproduction with this "improved" technology?
                    </span>
                    <span class="chi">
                        最后，文化滞后的概念中蕴含着一种隐藏的价值判断。 它隐含着这样一种观念，即技术是人类历史上一个进步的、动态的元素，社会和文化安排是阻碍的顽固根源。 但是，文化滞后是否有可能表明特定技术创新的危险性或不适用性？ 需要再次强调的是，仅仅因为某件事在技术上是可能的，并不一定意味着它应该被完成，或者人们应该服从它并对他们的生活做出必要的改变。 我们现在有能力将受精卵植入代孕母亲，然后由代孕母亲携带和分娩婴儿。 我们应该用这种"改进"的技术取代老式的繁殖方法吗？

As was noted in Chapter 10, advances in transportation and communications have made individuals and the communities in which they live less insular by facilitating the movement of people, goods, cultural elements, and ideas all over the world. Globalization has brought tai chi to Iowa, Delta blues to Japan, and pad thai to Ireland. Cultural change as result of globalization is not a new phenomenon; the music we listen to, the clothes that we wear, the language that we use, and the devices we employ have been strongly influenced by importations from other lands. What has made things different is the speed at which these transfusions occur. As was noted in Chapter 13, there was a time when major battles were fought by combatants who were unaware that an armistice had been declared weeks earlier. Today, even trivial news items are broadcast to the world at the speed of light. It is obvious that technological advances in transportation and communications have helped to create a more interconnected and fast-moving world, but is a truly globalized civilization emerging? Or to put it slightly differently, are all of the world's societies and cultures converging towards a common model?

                        The idea that the use of similar technologies results in cultural and social sameness has been around for a long while in the guise of an approach known as convergence theory. Closely associated with a belief in technological determinism, convergence theory argues that the nations of the world are becoming more similar to one another—that is, they are converging—as they make use of the same technologies. For example, running a steel mill or operating an airline does not allow substantial culturally based variations in the procedures employed. Many other examples of technologies requiring a certain kind of structure and mode of action can be cited, but the effects of modern technologies are not limited to particular industries; according to convergence theory, the process is demonstrated by commonalities in educational systems, family patterns, organizational structures, and even preferences in food and clothing as they all move toward a universal pattern.

                        使用类似技术导致文化和社会相同的想法以一种称为融合理论的方法为幌子已经存在很长时间了。 融合理论与技术决定论的信念密切相关，它认为世界各国在使用相同的技术时变得越来越相似——也就是说，它们正在融合。 例如，经营一家钢厂或经营一家航空公司不允许在所采用的程序中存在实质性的基于文化的差异。 可以举出许多其他需要某种结构和作用方式的技术示例，但现代技术的影响并不限于特定行业； 根据趋同理论，这一过程表现为教育系统、家庭模式、组织结构，甚至衣食偏好的共性，因为它们都朝着普遍模式发展。

                        In geometry, convergence means that several lines are all moving toward a single point. Convergence theory, however, usually assumes that countries with relatively low technological levels will move toward a point already occupied by technologically advanced countries, most of which have been in the orbit of European culture (Japan being the notable exception). Since most advanced technologies have originated in Europe and North America, other countries will have to adopt Western institutions and culture if they are to make effective use of modern technologies. In other words, convergence really means Westernization. This equation of modernity with Western culture is embodied in the remark of a U.S. senator who, early in the twentieth century, expressed the hope that "we will lift Shanghai up and up, ever up, until it is just like Kansas City."

                        This was a prospect that many Chinese did not view with pleasure. Throughout most of their history the Chinese have been wary of foreign importations, and not even the adoption of Communist ideology altered this fundamental attitude. Especially when under the influence of Mao Zedong's ideology, many Chinese had misgivings about the adoption of foreign technologies. The underlying hostility toward the use of foreign technologies strongly asserted itself during the second half of the 1960s, when China was racked by the internal struggles that went under the name of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Among the victims of the often bloody conflicts that occurred during this period were technical experts who were accused of being captivated by foreign technologies and opposed to the efforts of China's workers and peasants to develop indigenous technologies. Opponents of the use of foreign technologies also feared that these technologies would be accompanied by unacceptable foreign cultural patterns. Imported technologies, it was feared, inevitably would be accompanied by "bourgeois" habits and "decadent" activities. Elements of this mentality remain today, as authorities have created "the Great Firewall of China" in the hope of blocking outside influences carried over the internet.

                        China's concerns about foreign influences have not been unique; throughout the Third World today can be found the apprehension that technologies developed in modern countries will result in the disruption of traditional social and cultural patterns. In some countries these apprehensions have motivated a return to traditional cultural patterns. This has been most notable in Iran, where the social and cultural disruption brought on by rapid economic modernization has led to the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism. Even in places where the reaction has not been as strong, many have mourned the passing of traditional patterns of life and thought, and their replacement by a social order that rejects established ways in favor of the latest novelties, and where a cold rationality intrudes into all human relationships.

But is it really true that technological modernization has to be obtained as a complete package, and that it destroys all existing cultural patterns that are not favorable to it? Although it has been widely accepted, much of the evidence for convergence theory is impressionistic and anecdotal. Rigorous empirical tests are not abundant, and they do not always come to the same conclusion. In support of convergence theory, one study of Korean automobile workers found that exposure to industrial technology produced patterns of behavior and belief that were similar to the patterns exhibited by Italian and Argentinean automobile workers when their countries were at similar levels of industrialization. On the other hand, another study found that the values of individual workers were much more affected by their nationality than the kind of work they did; Brazilian oil refinery workers held values and beliefs that more closely resembled those held by farmers in their country than those held by their occupational counterparts in India or Ghana.

                        A study by Robert Marsh took up the issue by hypothesizing that economically developed societies would exhibit less variation in the key characteristics of their social structures (form of governance, composition of the labor force, educational institutions, communications media, and so on) than less developed countries.Economically developed countries have more specialization than less developed ones, making social interactions both essential and frequent. These interactions need to be mutually comprehensible and predictable, which necessitates more uniformity. To take a concrete example, a buyer and a seller of some commodity or service need to assume that their transaction will not be affected by differences in their gender, ethnicity, tribal membership, or other "particularistic" identities. This essential uniformity is made possible by similar institutional characteristics across developed countries, such as centralized governments, high levels of school enrollment for girls and women, and widespread consumption of newspapers, television, and other communications media. Marsh's research found that some less-developed countries resembled more advanced countries in some of their characteristics, such as widespread educational opportunities for girls and women. But his essential finding was that, on the whole, these countries exhibited much more variation than was found in developed countries. In other words, many of the structural elements of a developed country undergo a process of convergence with other developed countries, resulting in a greater degree of uniformity in many key social, economic, and political categories than in less-developed countries. Equally important, the research demonstrated that the extent of uniformity in developed countries increased over time.

                        Although the case for convergence theory is plausible on both theoretical and empirical grounds, the role of technological change in promoting the convergence of societies is less certain. It would certainly be a stretch to think of technological change as a universal solvent that dissolves all prior cultural and social patterns so that they conform to the presumed dictates of modern technology. The effects of specific technologies or of technological change in the aggregate are complex in the extreme, and it is simplistic to expect that all of the features of a society will be summarily transformed in accordance with technology's requirements. In this matter, it is useful to consider the words of David Landes: "Clearly there are no rigid compulsory relationships between a modern industrial economy and the entirety of its complex, multifaceted environment. Rather there is a wide range of links, direct and indirect, tight and loose, exclusive and partial, and each industrializing society develops its own combination of elements to fit its traditions, possibilities, and circumstances." Every society has its distinctive characteristics, and a particular technology will not necessarily produce the same effects for all that employ it. The actual consequences of a particular technology depend on why people have developed or adopted it in the first place. Having invented gunpowder, the Chinese used it for rockets and primitive cannon, but fireworks became the main application. In contrast, in late medieval Europe gunpowder was eagerly employed as the basis of increasingly destructive weaponry. The uses to which a technology is put depends on history, existing social arrangements, and the distribution of power.

In contrast, authoritarian states have used television to trumpet the achievements of their regime, and a great deal of programming consists of stories that glorify the political leadership.

But as anyone who has driven outside his or her native land will attest, driving styles can vary greatly from place to place. In other cases, imported technologies may be accompanied by parallel behavioral and cultural changes, but these will be confined to a few enclaves that exert little influence over their surrounding society. Medical procedures at elite hospitals in poor countries may be similar to those in the developed world, but these are not available to the bulk of the populace. In sum, the introduction of new technologies may play a significant role in transforming a society, but only in conjunction with organizational, cultural, and other changes, and these usually unfold over a much longer period of time, if at all.

Scientific inquiry was not the exclusive province of professional scientists, so amateurs could make significant contributions.

The great technological achievements of our time are to a significant degree a reflection of the enormous growth of knowledge that has taken place, but at the same time, this "knowledge explosion" has made all of us relative ignoramuses.

Most technologies are built on a base of specialized knowledge; if most people are incapable of comprehending that knowledge, there looms the danger that the direction of technology will be left to the small cadre who are. When public choices depend on expert information, experts and not the electorate will supply and evaluate this information. If this happens on a widespread scale, democracy becomes an illusion.

                        But what does it mean to be "right"? Technologies cannot be judged purely according to their technical merit. Their social consequences have to be considered, and when this happens, value judgments often have to be made. These judgments necessarily take the expert well outside the realm of his or her expertise. To illustrate, biologists might agree that a new medical technology is effective in allowing a couple to choose the sex of the child they intend to have. More crudely, in some countries sonograms can be used to identify the sex of a fetus, which may be aborted if it is of the "wrong" gender—that is, female. These may be effective technologies, but should they be used? If they are used, the likely result will be a lopsided sex ratio where boys and men substantially outnumber girls and women. Over time this will result in a very large cohort of men with no hope of ever getting married, and a host of problems for society as a whole.

                        但是"正确"是什么意思呢？ 不能纯粹根据技术优点来判断技术。 必须考虑它们的社会后果，当发生这种情况时，通常必须做出价值判断。 这些判断必然使专家远远超出他或她的专业领域。 举个例子，生物学家可能会同意这一点：新医疗技术在允许夫妇选择他们孩子的性别。 更粗略的是：在一些国家，超声波可以用来识别胎儿的性别，如果是"错误"的性别——比如女性，则可能会流产。 这些技术可能是有效的，但应该使用它们吗？ 如果使用它们，这可能导致性别比例失衡，男孩和男人的数量大大超过女孩和女人。 随着时间的推移，这将导致一大群没有结婚希望的男人，以及整个社会的一系列问题。

                        Even when an issue seems to revolve solely around technical matters, hidden value judgments have a way of sneaking in. Many sophisticated tools used by experts, such as cost-benefit analysis, achieve apparent precision because they are based on simplifying assumptions that may reveal the analyst's own preferences. To take the most obvious example, some cost-benefit analyses require the determination of the value of a human life, which has some objective basis, such as expected future earning power, but also may be affected by a government's interest in promoting life-saving regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency under the presidency of George W. Bush set $6.8 million as the value of a human life. When the Obama administration took over, the figure was raised to $9.1 million. At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration reckoned that a human life was worth $7.9 million, $2.9 million more than the number used at the end of the Bush administration. Meanwhile, the figure used by the Department of Transportation remained the same at $6 million for each life.

                        Public ignorance of technical matters may also be compounded by the desire of some experts to keep their knowledge secret. An expert can bolster his or her importance by being the sole source of important knowledge. The arcane nature of scientific and technological knowledge makes this inevitable to a certain degree, but experts have been known to draw a veil of mystery over their work in order to enhance their positions. The organizations in which they work have done the same thing. As Max Weber pointed out many decades ago, organizations commonly seek to expand their power and insulate themselves from outside pressures by keeping their knowledge secret.

                        In addition to undermining democratic participation, secrecy can also result in bad decisions because it promotes "groupthink." The only people deemed to be fully qualified experts are those who have access to secrets, and these secrets are accessible only to people within the same tight circle. As a result, everyone involved in a new technological project is an enthusiastic supporter, while potential opponents are excluded from the action. Major decisions can thus be made by a cadre of self-interested enthusiasts who are unchallenged by an informed opposition. The decisions to support the Concorde supersonic airliner and an ambitious atomic energy program in Britain occurred under precisely these circumstances.

                        Most experts are employed by organizations that are likely to have a stake in an issue where expert opinion is sought. The commercial value of research has at times created such a close relationship between profit-making enterprises on one hand and scientific and technical experts on the other that free-standing experts are almost nonexistent in some areas of research. To take one notable example, until the practice was banned in 2004, researchers at the National Institutes of Health could receive payments for consulting work from pharmaceutical firms. Close ties, financial and otherwise, between researchers and these firms have also motivated some medical journals to require that contributors divulge these connections when presenting the results of their research. Another example of independent technical expertise being undermined by the experts' entanglement with other organizations and programs is provided by a software systems analyst who was asked to serve on an advisory panel that was to make recommendations regarding the computer development program for the Strategic Defense Initiative (The "Star Wars" anti-ballistic weapon program):

                        Of course, even if some experts are not inclined to challenge technological policies, there may be other persons who will. Ralph Nader, in calling attention to the shortcomings of automobiles in the 1960s, especially in regard to safety or the lack of it, probably has done more to affect their design than any single engineer. Nuclear power has been under assault from a variety of quarters, and it is not likely that the issue will be resolved on the basis of purely technical criteria. Decisions to develop new military technologies can be intensely political. Technical considerations are important but not preeminent, for the decision to develop and deploy a new weapons system usually has significant economic, political, and strategic ramifications.

                        When major policy decisions are at stake, experts will likely find that their technical knowledge cannot easily be converted into political influence. This can be seen in the usual fate of advisory committees of recognized experts that have been convened by the government in order to address a major scientific or technological issue. A great deal of effort is often expended by these committees, but their recommendations are likely to be ignored if they go against existing policies of the executive branch, expose the administration to political difficulties, or invite the wrath of special interest groups. On occasion, presidents have buried committee reports if they challenge intended policies. For example, in the late 1960s a presidential advisory committee produced a report that was sharply critical of the proposed supersonic passenger airplane, a project strongly supported by the Nixon administration. Faced with this internal opposition, the White House simply kept the report confidential. Members of Congress were not allowed to see it for many months, until one congressman was able to secure the release of some parts of it. This was not an isolated case. The use of confidentiality has prevented other reports from seeing the light of day. When this happens, the public at large may simply assume that the experts' advice has been followed or that it has been overridden for good reasons. As a result, the scientific advisory system may simply provide a facade that allows the president to legitimize his decisions about science and technology policy.

                        当重大政策决定遭遇挑战时，专家们可能会发现他们的技术知识不能很容易地转化为政治影响力。 这可以从由政府为解决重大科学技术问题而召集的知名专家咨询委员会的通常命运中看出。 这些委员会往往花费大量精力，但如果他们的建议违背行政部门的现有政策，使政府面临政治困难，或招致特殊利益集团的愤怒，他们的建议很可能会被忽视。 有时，如果总统对预期的政策提出质疑，他们会隐藏委员会的报告。 例如，在 1960 年代后期，尼克松总统的咨询委员会编写的一份针对政府大力支持的超音速客机计划提出严厉批评的报告。

                        In sum, experts are in a position to influence the course of technological change, but at the same time they face many difficulties in converting their knowledge into power. Being free from outside influences and having the correct technical answers aren't enough; wielding power requires the mobilization of a constituency and the ability to create a broad base of support. Even outside government, technological decisions have the same political character, with the same need for gathering support for projects and policies. This means that except for fairly trivial matters, issues are not settled on the basis of purely technical considerations.

As we shall see, more is involved in their work than the exercise of purely technical skills. In a modern economy the design and development of new technologies is largely the work of engineers and other technical specialists. It seems natural, then, to expect that a great deal of control over the direction of technological development should be exercised by members of these occupations. Moreover, since so much of our world is shaped by technology, technical experts might be expected to have a powerful influence on society as a whole.

                        As we have seen in Chapter 2, some have argued that technocracy, the exercise of political authority by engineers and other technical experts, was the soundest and most rational way to govern. One of the most systematic and influential statements of the virtues of technocracy was the work of a sociologist/economist named Thorstein Veblen, who expounded his ideas during the first two decades of the twentieth century. According to Veblen, engineers and other technical experts were the "indispensable factor in the everyday work of carrying on the country's productive industry." But at the same time, "they have nothing to say in the planning and direction of this industrial system, except as employees in the pay of financiers." It was this contradiction between the technical acumen of the engineers and their subjugation to managerial control that Veblen saw as the greatest obstacle to continued economic progress. The only solution was a takeover of business enterprises by a "Soviet of Technicians" so that the economy would be continuously stimulated by technological advance instead of being retarded by the narrow financial interests of absentee owners and their delegated managers.

                        正如我们在第 2 章中看到的，有些人认为技术官僚主义，即由工程师和其他技术专家行使政治权威是最合理、最合理的治理方式。 对技术专家治国美德的最系统和最有影响力的陈述之一是社会学家/经济学家托尔斯坦·凡勃伦 (Thorstein Veblen) 的著作，他在 20 世纪的前二十年阐述了他的观点。凡勃伦认为，工程师和其他技术专家是"进行生产性工业日常工作的不可或缺的一环"。 但同时，"他们除了作为金融家支付报酬的雇员外，在这个产业体系的规划和方向上没有话语权。" 正是工程师的技术敏锐度与对他们的管理控制的压制之间的这种矛盾，被凡勃伦视为经济持续进步的最大障碍。 唯一的解决办法是由"技术人员苏维埃"接管企业，这样经济就会不断受到技术进步的刺激，而不是被缺席的所有者及其受托管理人员的狭隘经济利益所阻碍。

                        Veblen's ideas provided inspiration for a technocratic political movement that flourished for a brief period during the 1930s and then expired. But the idea that technical expertise should be the proper basis of control did not die with it. Several decades later, a number of social scientists advanced the idea that Veblen's prescriptions had been achieved; the enterprises of advanced industrial economies were now under the control of engineers and other technologically oriented personnel. For sociologist Daniel Bell, the key personnel in modern corporations were the "corporate organizers," a "special breed, often engineers, whose self-conscious task was to build a new economic form." A similar theme was sounded by economist John Kenneth Galbraith in his influential book The New Industrial State. Galbraith argued that the owners of large business firms no longer ran them, as had been the case in the days of the traditional entrepreneur. Instead, the management of modern enterprises was now in the hands of the "technostructure": managers and engineers with the specialized knowledge and talent essential to planning and decision-making.

                        凡勃伦的思想为技术官僚政治运动提供了灵感，该运动在 1930 年代短暂繁荣，然后就消亡了。 但是，技术专长应该是适当的控制基础的想法并没有随之消亡。 几十年后，一些社会科学家引申了凡勃伦的理论并将其变成了现实； 发达工业经济体的企业现在处于工程师和其他技术型人员的控制之下。社会学家丹尼尔·贝尔(Daniel Bell)认为，现代企业的关键是"企业组织者"，他们是"一个特殊的族群，通常是工程师，他们的自觉是建立一种新的经济形式。" 经济学家约翰·肯尼思·加尔布雷思 (John Kenneth Galbraith) 在其颇具影响力的著作《新工业国家》(The New Industrial State) 中也提出了类似的观点。 加尔布雷思认为，大型商业公司的所有者不再像传统企业家时代那样经营它们。 相反，现代企业的管理现在掌握在"技术结构"的手中：由具有规划和决策的经理和工程师等专业知识和人才组成。

                        According to Galbraith's formulations, the members of the technostructure brought a new set of goals to corporations and other productive enterprises. Since they were not the main holders of company stock, they would not be the primary beneficiaries of increased profits. Consequently, the main goal of the new managerial elite was not the maximization of profits. Rather, the technostructure was primarily concerned with maximizing corporate growth and fostering the technological innovations that made this possible. No longer was technological advance held in check by the narrow financial concerns of Veblen's absentee owners; the administration of productive enterprises by engineers and like-minded managers guaranteed the continual improvement of products and production techniques. Equally important, the decisions of engineers and their intellectual kin determined the general trajectory of the economy and society.

                        Many of the assertions presented in The New Industrial State have been largely refuted in the decades following the book's publication. But one concept is at least worthy of further inquiry. Galbraith's invocation of the "technostructure" has directed our attention to the role of engineers and other technical experts in the management of modern firms. As subsequent research has shown, engineers as a group are deeply involved in management, but they do not form a technocratic elite, nor, at the other end of the spectrum, are they simply hired hands.

                        In understanding the role played by engineers it is important to note that, along with other skilled occupational groups, engineers expect to be recognized as professionals. At the most basic level, the work of a professional centers on the possession and application of knowledge that is found only within the ranks of the profession. This means that someone outside the profession is not qualified to pass judgment on working professionals; only other professionals are able to do so. Consequently, the essence of professionalism is autonomy. This has been evident in the long-established professions, such as medicine and law, where doctors and attorneys have been accustomed to the insulation of their careers from outside forces. In part, this has been due to the fact that, until fairly recently at least, they have been in business for themselves as independent practitioners. But this has not been the case with engineers. Except for a small number of private consultants, engineers have been the employees of an organization, usually some sort of business enterprise.

                        在理解工程师所扮演的角色时，重要的是要注意，与其他技能职业群体一样，工程师希望被视为专业人士。在最基本的层面上，专业中心的工作是关于知识的掌握和应用，而这些知识只能在该专业的队伍中找到。这意味着专业以外的人没有资格对在职专业人士做出判断；只有其他专业人士才能这样做。因此，专业精神的本质是自主性。这在历史悠久的行业中很明显，例如医学和法律，在这些行业中，医生和律师已经习惯于将他们的职业与外部力量隔离开来。部分原因是，至少直到最近，他们一直以独立从业者的身份开展业务。但工程师的情况并非如此。除了少数私人顾问外，工程师都是组织的雇员，通常是某种商业企业。

                        While serving as employees, engineers do enjoy a considerable amount of freedom as they go about their work. They are not subject to rigid supervision, and they have considerable discretion regarding how they plan their activities and schedule their work. They have to respond to the requests of management and deal with the problems presented to them, but they have wide latitude in determining how the job is done. At the same time, however, the work of engineers is closely constrained by the expectations of their employers. While they have the freedom to decide how a job is to be done, engineers have little influence over the choice of what is to be done. And, in truth, few engineers are concerned about their lack of influence in the setting of company policies or the purposes to which their talents are being put. The engineer's training and on-the-job socialization do not produce ambitions of this sort. The work of engineers exemplifies the rational search for the best way of attaining particular ends. But engineers rarely have the privilege of selecting these ends. Indeed, once they do, they no longer act as engineers.

                        While engineers are subject to managerial authority, they often exert their own authority by joining the ranks of management. This is a common transition; nearly two-thirds of engineers in the United States become managers during at least part of their career. At the same time, however, the movement of engineers into management has the paradoxical result of further diluting the engineers' influence. For most engineers, success in one's career means attaining a managerial position, not being an increasingly proficient engineer.

                        工程师虽然受制于管理层，但他们往往通过加入管理层来行使自己的权力。 这是一个常见的过渡； 在美国，近三分之二的工程师至少在其部分职业生涯中成为经理。 然而，与此同时，工程师向管理层的转移也带来了进一步稀释工程师影响力的矛盾结果。 对于大多数工程师来说，职业生涯的成功意味着获得管理职位，而不是成为一名越来越熟练的工程师。

                        Engineering and management require different skills and orientations. As Samuel C. Florman summarizes, "The characteristics of a good manager—a feeling for people, politics and the bottom line—appear to conflict with those of a first rate creative engineer—an aptitude for numbers, theorems, materials, and spatial relationships." But while orientations and even fundamental values may conflict, with the prospect of a managerial career dangled in front of him or her, a practicing engineer is not likely to challenge managerial values, even when they may conflict with the engineer's professional values. Expert knowledge and a lifetime devotion to the acquisition and use of that knowledge are central to the professional's value system; in contrast, businesspersons and managers value loyalty and personal initiative. The prospect of moving from engineering into management can affect a person's values and undercut his or her identity as an engineer.

                        The problems of an engineer influencing company policy are illustrated by the dangers of "whistle-blowing." A whistle-blower is someone who detects some sort of wrongdoing within his or her organization and brings it to the attention of the public. An engineer can be put in this position when management makes a decision that is so technically unsound or otherwise defective that it poses a threat to the user or to society as a whole. Since an engineer knows the technical facts of a case better than anyone else, he or she is in the best position to reveal whatever problems have appeared.Engineers may be willing to call attention to serious problems because of their conviction that "the facts speak for themselves." In this they are sadly naive. Most engineers work in organizational settings with strong hierarchical structures. Decisions are made in accordance with vertical relationships; those at the upper levels can countermand those at the lower level, even if the latter have the "facts" in their favor. This is dramatically illustrated by the experiences of some engineers who worked for a major defense contractor. After a chief engineer designed an aircraft disc brake that was woefully deficient in stopping power, he enlisted the support of his superiors in falsifying crucial test data. When a lower-level engineer and a technical writer objected, they were told to keep their mouths shut and participate in the falsification. Subsequent testing by the Air Force revealed the brake's dangerous shortcomings. Deeply disturbed by the whole process, the dissenting engineer and the writer resigned from their positions. All of the conspirators retained their jobs, except for two who were promoted to higher positions.

                        The hierarchical structure of organizations also helps management to control communication; employees are expected to "go through channels." Facts that pose a challenge to a superior can thus easily be suppressed. The only alternative is circumventing the hierarchy; a concerned employee can attempt to get the attention of officials at much higher levels of the organization, or he or she can reveal malfeasance to the media or some other outside agency. These are risky courses of action. Top-level officials don't like disturbances of conventional channels of authority, and they are also likely to have doubts about an employee who has gone behind the boss's back. Revealing a problem to the media or an outside agency is an even worse breach of proper organizational behavior. Loyalty is much prized in organizations, and an employee who is perceived as being disloyal to his or her superior or to the organization as a whole is someone to be scorned.

A group of engineers from Morton-Thiokol, the manufacturer of the Shuttle's solid-fuel booster rocket, had warned the night before the launch that cold weather could cause a failure of the O-rings that sealed the segments of the booster rockets. After the erosion of an O-ring resulted in the tragedy that many had feared, Roger Boisjoly, a specialist in seals who had worked on NASA projects for 20 years, used his testimony before the official government board of inquiry to narrate the technical and managerial failures that led to the tragedy. This soon led to his being ostracized and isolated at Morton-Thiokol. Eventually diagnosed as suffering from traumatic stress, Boisjoly left his secure and remunerative job, sold his house, and moved out of the community in which he had lived for many years. Although he earned some income by giving lectures on the causes of the disaster, Boisjoly continued to suffer considerable financial hardship and psychological strain.

                        The battle of an engineer against his or her organization is likely to be a lonely one. Especially unfortunate is the fact that the professional engineering associations usually are not very helpful to the whistle-blower. These associations have often been dominated by businessmen who are more likely to be concerned with their industry than they are with the career concerns of individual engineers. This is illustrated by the case of Ernest Fitzgerald, who was summarily fired after he had called attention to the huge cost overruns on the Lockheed C5A transport plane. His professional association, the American Institute of Industrial Engineers, spurned Fitzgerald's request to "investigate the professional and ethical questions involved." It refused on the grounds that it was a "technical organization," and not a "professional society." The inclusion of military contractors as members of the Institute made this a likely outcome.

                        From this brief survey, it should be apparent that engineers do not exercise commanding influence over the course of technological change. Their work, while essential to technological development, is constrained by the organizational environment in which engineering operates. The crucial decisions are made by management, and even if engineers are often recruited into its ranks, when this happens they necessarily change their orientations. Managers must be primarily concerned with profit or some other organizational goal; technical virtuosity cannot be an end in itself. If we are looking for a major source of control over technology, we therefore need to look beyond engineers to the organizations that employ them. This will be done in the next chapter.

In fact, organizational structures can be of supreme importance; some promote workplaces that are challenging, involving, and sources of satisfaction, while work performed under different structural conditions is "just a job" that provides a paycheck and little else. The same can be said about the kinds of technologies found in different work environments. Some workplace technologies have the potential to empower workers and make their work a meaningful activity, while other technologies have the opposite effect.

                        Quite a lot of research on the relationship between technologies and organizational structures was conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, considerably more than in recent years. One such study was conducted by Robert Blauner. His research focused on a number of different industries that exemplified particular types of technologies and how these affected organizations and their employees. His examples were drawn from the industrial sector at a time when making things constituted a larger part of the economy than it does today. Nevertheless, his research has provided some useful ways of considering the relationship between production technologies and organizational patterns. His first example, printing, was characterized by a set of activities reminiscent of traditional craft occupations that required a high degree of worker skill and involvement. Conducting his research at a time before the invention of computerized typesetting equipment, Blauner found that the absence of specialized machinery resulted in a work environment that allowed a great deal of worker autonomy. In contrast, textile mill operatives were little more than machine-minders. Their activities had to be closely attuned to the demands of the equipment, so there was little room for individual initiative. The third industry studied was the automobile industry, which used assembly-line operations that forced the worker to submit to a rigid scheduling of activities that was dictated by the inexorable movement of the line. Finally, and in sharp contrast, continuous process industries, such as chemical manufacture or oil refining, made use of highly sophisticated technologies, but unlike textile production or automobile manufacture, they required considerable worker involvement and initiative. Workers had to carefully monitor production processes and take decisive action when the inevitable problems occurred. Their work could not be precisely scheduled or regulated, and they enjoyed a considerable amount of on-the-job freedom.

                        1960 年代和 1970 年代对技术与组织结构之间的关系进行了大量研究，其数目远多于近年。 罗伯特·布劳纳 (Robert Blauner) 进行了一项这样的研究。 他的研究集中在许多不同行业，这些行业体现了特定类型的技术以及这些技术如何影响组织及其员工。 他的例子取自工业部门，当时制造业在经济中所占的比例比今天更大。尽管如此，他的研究为评估生产技术和组织模式之间的关系提供了一些有效手段。 他的第一个例子是印刷，其特点是一系列让人联想到传统手工业的需要高度工人技术的活动。 他的研究发生在计算机排版设备发明之前，Blauner 发现没有专门的机器让工作环境允许工人有很大的自主权。 相比之下，纺织厂的操作工只不过是机器管理员。 他们的活动必须密切配合设备的需求，因此个人主动性的空间很小。研究的第三个行业是汽车行业，它使用装配线操作，迫使工人服从由生产线的无情运动决定的严格的活动安排。 最后，与此形成鲜明对比的是，化学制造或炼油等连续加工工业使用高度复杂的技术，但与纺织生产或汽车制造不同，它们需要大量的工人参与和主动性。 工人必须仔细监控生产过程，并在不可避免的问题发生时采取果断行动。 他们的工作无法被精确地安排或调节，他们在工作中享有相当大的自由。

                        Whereas Blauner's study focused on the relationship between the technology used by an industry and its effects on workers, Joan Woodward's inquiries centered on how different technologies affected organizational structures per se. Of particular concern to her were such structural variables as the number of levels in the managerial hierarchy, the ratio of managers to other personnel, the number of people supervised by first-line managers, and the flexibility of the managerial system. Woodward was not concerned with individual technologies, but with general manufacturing processes. Her mode of analysis made use of three broad categories: unit and small-batch production (such as shipbuilding or the manufacture of large transformers), large-batch and mass production (as exemplified by automobile manufacture), and process production (such as the production of chemical or petroleum products).

                        According to Woodward, each of these categories was distinguished by differences in technological complexity and the extent to which uncertainty could be reduced through the application of routine procedures. These differences, in turn, resulted in different types of organizational structures, each with their distinctive processes. Mass-production technologies required routinized processes, narrowly defined job duties, and a clear hierarchy of authority that kept a firm grip on things. In contrast, the two other methods of production—unit production and continuous process production—were much less rigid in their operations and had a regular flow of worker-management communication that was not filtered according to hierarchical position. In similar fashion, the span of control—the number of workers under a single supervisor—was greatest in firms using mass-production technologies. Other kinds of organizational differences also seemed to reflect production technologies. Managerial specialization occurred more frequently in mass-production firms, and process production technologies required a higher ratio of managers to other personnel than was the case in organizations using different productive technologies. More relationships could be cited, but Woodward's essential point is that organizational forms must be matched to production technologies. In practical terms, an effective organization is one that uses structures and procedures that are appropriate to the productive technology employed.

                        根据伍德沃德的说法，这些类别中的每一个都因技术复杂性和通过应用常规程序可以减少不确定性的程度而有所不同。 这些差异反过来又导致了不同类型的组织结构，每种结构都有其独特的流程。 大规模生产技术需要常规化流程、严格定义的工作职责以及清晰的权力等级以牢牢掌握事物。 相比之下，另外两种生产方法——单元生产和连续过程生产——在操作上没有那么严格，并且有定期的工人-管理层交流，没有根据层级位置进行过滤。类似地，控制范围——单一主管下的工人数量——在使用大规模生产技术的公司中最大。 其他类型的组织差异似乎也反映了生产技术。 管理专业化在大规模生产企业中更为频繁，与使用不同生产技术的组织相比，流程生产技术需要更高的管理人员与其他人员的比例。 可以引用更多的关系，但伍德沃德的要点是组织形式必须与生产技术相匹配。 实际上，一个有效的组织是使用和其自身生产技术相匹配的结构和程序的组织。

                        Another example of an organizational theory guided by a consideration of technology has been provided by the work of Charles Perrow. Perrow's theory is pitched at a more general level than that of Blauner or Woodward. Instead of considering specific types of production technologies, Perrow considers two basic aspects of the work undertaken within an organization: the degree of variability of the raw materials processed by the organization, and the extent to which problem-solving procedures can be routinized. By raw materials, Perrow does not mean just inanimate objects; iron ore is a basic raw material for a steel mill, but for an employment agency, people are its major raw material. In "processing" its raw materials, an organization will confront different degrees of difficulty. Perrow's analysis of the problem-solving process centers on the number of exceptional cases that must be confronted and the extent to which the problem-solving procedures are "analyz-able"—that is, the extent to which they can be reduced to a routine. Different kinds of organizations are characterized by different combinations of these elements:

                        Perrow's implicit definition of technology is quite general and abstract. Technology is simply defined as a way of doing things, and no attention is paid to the material artifacts that are part of these technologies. What is important is the nature of the raw material and methods needed to convert it into the organization's products. Above all, Perrow is concerned with organizational effectiveness. A major conclusion of his analysis is that the organizational structure should reflect the particular qualities of the raw materials being used and the technology used for their transformation. To be effective, an organization must use technologies appropriate to its tasks. His conclusions are thus similar to Woodward's: there is no such thing as an optimal organizational form that is universally valid. Everything depends on how things are produced and the materials from which they are made.

                        These studies, and others like them, have sensitized organizational theorists to the influence of technology on organizational structures and processes, albeit at the risk of drifting toward technological determinism. Yet at the same time, few hard-and-fast conclusions can be asserted. Some empirical studies have found no relationship between an organization's technology and its structure, but taken as a whole, research into organizations has shown that their structures and processes are influenced by the technologies that they use, although the relationship is not particularly strong.

                        The lack of a definitive relationship between technology and organizational structure is understandable, given the complexity of most organizations. Rather than making use of a single technology, organizations employ a variety of technologies, especially when they have numerous functional divisions. An R&D laboratory and an accounting office may be components of the same organization, but their technologies will differ substantially. Accordingly, the linkage between technology and organizational structure is likely to be more evident when the basic element of analysis is the work unit rather than the organization as a whole. Even here, the relationship is not likely to be an exact one, as the size of the organization and its components have also been shown to strongly affect organizational structure, no matter what technologies are employed.

                        What does seem clear, however, is that a crucial variable connecting technology and organizational structure is the degree to which an organization's operations consist of routine activities. What is meant by "routine" in this context is the kind of activities that can be done by following standardized procedures. The job of a cook in a fast-food restaurant is mostly a matter of cooking a few items according to a preset timer and doling out portions of ketchup from a dispenser that always supplies the same quantity. Contrast this with the work of a chef in a high-end restaurant, who uses a variety of cooking techniques, develops new dishes, and makes use of seasonally available fruits and vegetables. Technologies that reduce work to preset routines are a good fit with formalized organizational structures and their well-articulated rules, clearly defined responsibilities, and fixed lines of authority.

                        然而，似乎很清楚的是，连接技术和组织结构的一个关键变量是"组织运营由例行程序组成的程度"。 在这种情况下，"例行程序"是指可以通过遵循标准化程序来完成的活动类型。 快餐店厨师的工作主要是根据预设的计时器烹饪一些食物，然后从始终供应相同数量的分配器中分发部分番茄酱。 相比之下，高档餐厅的厨师使用各种烹饪技术，开发新菜式，并使用时令水果和蔬菜。 将工作减少到例行程序的技术以其清晰的规则、明确定义的职责和固定的权限，非常适合正式的组织结构。

                        Although the technologies they use influence the way that organizations are structured, this is not the end of the story. Organizational structures are created by individual men and women, and as such they reflect the cultural traits that these individuals bring to the organization. These, in turn, will affect the relationship between technology and organizational structure. One study of manufacturing plants in Britain, France, and Germany found that the relationship between technology and organizational structure found by Woodward did not hold when a cross-national analysis was undertaken. No matter what the level of technological complexity, German firms had higher levels of worker expertise, autonomy, and flexibility than French firms, while British firms were in an intermediate position. In similar fashion, a study of American and Japanese factories found that there was less specialization and taller hierarchies in the Japanese firms even when the technologies used were substantially identical to the ones employed in the American factories.

                        尽管他们使用的技术影响了组织的结构方式，但这并不是故事的结局。组织结构是由个人创建的，因此，它们反映了这些个人为组织带来的文化特征。这反过来又会影响技术与组织结构之间的关系。当伍德沃德进行一项针对英国、法国和德国制造工厂的跨国分析时发现技术与组织结构之间的关系并不成立。无论技术复杂程度如何，德国公司都比法国公司拥有更高水平的工人专业知识、自主权和灵活性，而英国公司则处于中间位置。类似地，一项对美国和日本工厂的研究发现，即使所使用的技术与美国工厂采用的技术基本相同，日本公司的专业化程度更低，等级制度更高。

                        The influence of national cultures on organizational structures and processes illustrates an enduring problem in ascertaining the relationship between technology and organizational structure. Although many questions remain unanswered regarding this relationship, the studies that have been conducted have led to a significant rethinking of the nature of organizations and their management. As the idea took hold that an organization's structure was influenced by the technology it employed, it became apparent that one of the cherished notions of management, that there is "one best way" to organize things, is incorrect. As has been noted above, what works with one production technology will not necessarily work with another. In order to be successful, an organization needs to develop and use organizational structures and processes that are appropriate for the technologies it employs. As a result, many different kinds of organizational structures have been developed and used—matrix organizations, "ad-hocracies," task forces, project teams, loose aggregations of professionals, and "skunk works." And all the while, plain old bureaucratic organization is alive and well in places where it is still appropriate (and sometimes where it is not).

                        Up to now we have considered how technology affects organizations. Yet the reverse can also be true. Organizations can shape technological change through their ability to affect the supply and demand for a particular technology. We are a long way from Adam Smith's perfect market, where no individual firm is able to significantly influence the supply of a product or the demand for it. In regard to supply, an organization that accounts for a significant portion of an industry can strongly influence the technological development of the industry as a whole when it creates (or refrains from creating) new products. The choices of a few firms thus determine the kinds of cars we drive, the way steel is made, the operating systems used by our computers, and the links we get when we do a Google search. In similar fashion, when a few organizations are the major purchasers of particular products (as when a few aerospace firms buy highly specialized machine tools), their requirements will determine the nature of the product and the technology it embodies.

                        On what basis do organizations make technological choices? This is an important question, given the importance of organizational decisions for the course of technological change. Unfortunately, researchers have not paid much attention to this issue. Most of the studies centering on the connection between technology and organizational structures and processes simply take technology as a given. In the studies just summarized, the technologies used by organizations appeared as independent entities. These studies tacitly imply that organizations and their personnel react passively to the presumed dictates of technology, and in so doing they fall prey to technological determinism.

                        It is possible, however, that the technologies employed by an organization are themselves the product of the organization's own structure and processes, and, in particular, the configurations of power within the organization. Such a view would be in general accord with the perspective presented earlier in this book that technologies can be, and often are, employed by individuals or groups in order to advance their own interests. Charles Perrow, whose ideas were described a few pages ago, has recognized this, and in so doing has expressed some disenchantment with his earlier work in which he took technology to be an independent influence on an organization's structure. Perrow forcefully makes the point that, after all is said and done, organizations are powerful tools for achieving goals. Much therefore depends on who controls the tools, and for what purposes. A technology might be selected not because of its innate superiority but because it meets the needs of the power holders within that organization.

                        One example of this process can be found in the early history of electrical power in the United States. Until 1915 the most common sources of electrical power were small-scale generating plants that had been set up to serve individual homes, apartment buildings, or business enterprises. In the years that followed, these facilities went into decline as large generating stations serving a wide area came to be the dominant mode of generating electrical power. Some of the success of these stations can be attributed to more efficient operation through economies of scale, but more was involved than the pursuit of efficiency. Of considerable importance to the shaping of the American electrical power industry were two industry-wide organizations, the National Electric Light Association (NELA) and the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies (AEIC). These organizations were, in turn, strongly influenced by a few men who had close personal and organizational ties to Samuel Insull, the entrepreneur who played the leading role in the construction and operation of large-scale urban generating plants. Insull's associates used their strategic position within NELA and AEIC to determine the kinds of topics discussed at meetings of the two associations and the papers they published, and to take the lead in prescribing the equipment and procedures deemed best for the industry. Most importantly, the group was able to strongly influence the drafting of government regulations that worked to the advantage of privately owned, centralized generating plants, and to the detriment of local, small-scale facilities. In sum, the basic technological configuration of electricity generation was not solely the result of technical and economic requirements, but it also reflected the use of organizational power to advance the interests of particular individuals and firms.

                        Another noteworthy example of the choice of technology being affected bythe exercise of power in an organizational setting is provided by David Noble's study of the development of numerically controlled machine tools. During the early 1950s the Servomechanism Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the financial support of the U.S. Air Force, produced the first numerically controlled (NC) machine tools. Instead of being manipulated by skilled machinists, these devices were guided by programs stored on magnetic tape. NC technology increased productivity and allowed the precise machining of the complex shapes used in modern aircraft. At the same time, NC machine tools significantly reduced the amount of skilled labor required and removed a great deal of decision-making power from the machinists. These consequences could be taken as an unavoidable by-product of technological advance; that is, the technology determined the skills, work patterns, and hierarchical relationships found in a machine shop using NC machine tools.

                        The actual story is quite a bit more complicated. Most importantly, the use of numerical control was not the only way to make machine tools run automatically. During the late 1940s, a "record-playback" method for machine-tool guidance was developed. This technology recorded the motions of a machinist making a part. These motions were recorded on magnetic tape, which was then used to run the machine tool. The machinist, and not a programmer removed from the workplace, was thus the source of the machine's instructions. As it turned out, this was the greatest drawback of this technology. Numerical control was far more appealing to managers because it allowed them to gain more control over the work process. NC tools promised a reduction of the decision-making powers of workers and vested it with managers, engineers, and programmers. In the words of one manager: "Look, with record-playback the control of the machine rests with the machinist—control of feeds, speeds, number of cuts, output; with NC there is a shift of control to management. Management is no longer dependent upon the operator and can thus optimize the use of their machines. With NC, control over the process is placed firmly in the hands of management—and why shouldn't we have it?"

                        实际的故事要复杂得多。最重要的是，使用数控并不是使机床自动运行的唯一方法。在 1940 年代后期，开发了一种用于机床引导的"记录回放"方法。这项技术记录了制造零件的机械师的动作。这些运动被记录在磁带上，然后用于运行机床。这样一来，机械师，而不是从工作场所被移除的程序员，才是机器指令的来源。事实证明，这是这项技术的最大缺点。数字控制对管理人员更具吸引力，因为它使他们能够更好地控制工作流程。 数控工具可以减少工人的决策权，并将其交给经理、工程师和程序员。用一位经理的话来说："看，通过记录回放，机器的控制权在于机械师——进给、速度、切割次数、产量的控制；有了数控，控制权就转移到了管理上。管理不再依赖于操作员，因此可以优化他们机器的使用。有了数控，对流程的控制就牢牢掌握在管理层的手中——为什么我们不应该拥有它呢？"

As we have seen in Chapter 10, computer-controlled production systems have their drawbacks, and the fully automated factory is still a long way off, even with today's generation of computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Although machinists face only fair future employment prospects, their services are still needed; a worker lacking the necessary skills can do tens of thousands of dollars of damage in a few seconds. In today's industries, machinists with high levels of skill and a fair amount of autonomy continue to be essential.

                        The relationship between technology, worker skills, and organizational authority has become especially salient as a result of the incorporation of computers and automated systems into production processes. Modern information systems can be used to enhance the power and responsibilities of shop floor workers. At the same time, however, they can produce the opposite effect by giving management a greater capacity to centralize operations and restrict the discretion of the workers. As one manager asserted, "The more we can control with the computer, the less dependence we will have on operators with in-depth knowledge. When there is a problem, we will have computer programs, logic, electronic sensors. We will be able to understand the problems."

                        A certain degree of computer-based centralization may be justified in terms of its supposed contribution to coordination and efficiency. But this is hardly its only rationale. Many managers worry that computerized information systems can just as easily dilute managerial authority by making information more readily available to ordinary workers. A top executive from the same firm as the manager quoted above described the potential erosion of managerial authority:

                        Managers realize that the control of information has been an essential element of their authority. Consequently, in the words of one line manager, "Managers perceive workers who have information as a threat. They are afraid of not being the 'expert.' They are used to having everyone come to them and ask what to do." This use of information was duly noted by a worker in the same firm: "[Managers] can't share information with us, because only by holding on to knowledge that we don't have can they maintain their superiority and their ability to order us around."

As with NC machine tools, a technology may be employed because managers see it as a way of extending their own power. Conversely, computerized information systems may be used to empower workers, enhance their responsibilities, and give them a claim to higher wages. There is no simple technological logic governing the use of these systems. The use of an existing technology may reflect the existing distribution of power in an organization, while the installation of a new technology may become an occasion for conflict over how it will be wielded in the future.

                        Some of the issues surrounding the relationship between technological change and the evolution of organizational structures appear in sharper focus when we take a look at digital information technologies. Numerous scholars have pointed out that the essential work of organizations centers on the manipulation of information, broadly construed. Whether it is within an employment office, a bank, or a school, members of an organization spend a great deal of their time gathering information, analyzing it, deciding what to do in the light of what they have learned, communicating with others, and evaluating and reporting what has been done.

                        当我们研究数字信息技术时，一些围绕技术变革与组织结构演变之间关系的问题显得尤为突出。许多学者指出，广义上来说，组织的基本工作集中在对信息的操纵上。无论是在就业办公室、银行还是学校，组织的成员花费大量时间收集信息、分析信息、根据所学知识决定做什么、与他人交流以及评估和报告已经完成的工作。

                        During the second half of the nineteenth century, organizations were able to expand, improve their operations, and operate at higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness through the use of what were then novel technologies for gathering, recording, analyzing, distributing, and storing information—typewriters, telegraphs, dictating machines, telephones, pneumatic tubes, standardized forms, carbon paper, and filing systems. Recent decades have seen more revolutionary changes in information technology, and few of today's organizations can get along without computers, database management programs, word processing, spreadsheets, fax machines, the Internet, e-mail, photocopy machines, and voice mail, while growing numbers of organizations are making extensive use of more recently introduced technologies like smartphones, intranets for internal communications, and videoconferencing for linking participants from all over the globe in real time.

                        The nearly universal use of electronic information technologies has motivated a substantial number of researchers to conduct inquiries into how these technologies have affected the structure and functioning of contemporary organizations. In general, this research has indicated that advanced information technologies have speeded up operations, reduced costs, increased the amount and accessibility of information, and more extensively linked members of organizations. Less certain, however, are the effects of new information technologies on organizational structures and procedures. As with all significant technological advances, there is rarely a simple, straightforward connection between technological and organizational changes. A new information technology, no matter how radical, is only one of many influences on a particular organization, and not necessarily the most important one; other organizational features, such as size, the composition of the work force, and the nature of the clientele may be more significant than the information technologies in use.

                        One much-discussed issue has to do with the role of new information technologies in promoting organizational decentralization. As some students of organizations have argued, a primary reason for the concentration of organizational authority in times past was the difficulty of obtaining and analyzing information. Information was a scarce resource, something that could be provided for only a few members of an organization, those at the top of the managerial pyramid. In similar fashion, only those at the summit of the organization were deemed capable of intelligently acting on the information made available to them. In contrast, today's digital technologies make information and the ability to analyze it readily available at low cost, allowing more decentralized and participatory modes of decision making. This does seem to be happening; one study of 400 large firms found that greater levels of information technology were in fact associated with more delegation of authority to individuals and teams.

                    <span class="chi">
                        一个被广泛讨论的问题与新信息技术在促进组织权力下放方面的作用有关。正如一些组织研究人员所争论的那样，过去组织权力集中的一个主要原因是获取和分析信息的困难。信息是一种稀缺资源，只能提供给组织中处于管理金字塔顶端的少数成员。以类似的方式，只有组织最高层的人才被认为能够根据提供给他们的信息明智地采取行动。相比之下，当今的数字技术使信息及其分析能力以低成本随时可用，从而允许更加分散和参与的决策模式。这似乎正在发生；一项对 400 家大公司的研究发现，更高水平的信息技术实际上与向个人和团队下放更多权力有关。

                        The easy availability of information makes it possible to decentralize organizational authority and to empower workers, but as has been noted before, the way that a technology is used is not entirely determined by the technology itself. Whether a powerful information technology promotes centralization or decentralization may have more to do with existing distributions of power and authority than with presumed technological imperatives. Instead of democratizing the workplace, today's information technologies may be used to enhance managerial control. As we have seen in Chapter 11, some new workplace technologies, far from empowering workers, may enhance top-down control through the use of electronic monitoring.To take another example, it has sometimes been stated that the use of e-mail has eroded organizational hierarchies by allowing direct communications between the upper and lower ranks. This may come to pass when the top organizational echelons value and encourage bottom-up communications, but many managers would prefer to avoid such "distractions." Again, a great deal depends on what the members of the organization, especially the managerial cadre, want to do with new communications technologies. The variability of managerial response to electronic communications probably is one of the main reasons that attempts to link the use of e-mail with organizational decentralization have not produced conclusive results.

                        信息的易得性使得组织权力下放和赋予员工权力成为可能，但如前所述，技术的使用方式并不完全取决于技术本身。 强大的信息技术是促进集中化还是分散化可能更多地与现有的权力和权威分配有关，而不是假定的技术要求。 今天的信息技术可以用来加强管理控制，而不是使工作场所民主化。正如我们在第 11 章中看到的，一些新的工作场所中技术远非赋予员工权力，而是以电子监控的形式来增强自上而下的控制。 再举一个例子，有时有人说电子邮件的使用允许上下级之间的直接通信，从而削弱了组织的等级制度。 当最高组织梯队重视并鼓励自下而上的沟通时，这可能会发生，但许多经理更愿意避免这种"分心"。 同样，很大程度上取决于组织成员，尤其是管理干部，想用新的通信技术做什么。 管理层对电子通信的不同反应可能是试图将电子邮件的使用与组织权力下放联系起来的主要原因之一，但没有产生最终的结果。

                        As a final point, it should be kept in mind that new communications technologies do not necessarily supplant existing ones. For example, it might be expected that the growing use of the telephone in the early twentieth century reduced the need for traditional forms of communication, but in fact the opposite occurred, as telephone use seems to have stimulated the desire for more face-to-face communication, not less. The same thing may be happening today. New electronic media such as e-mail and videoconferencing certainly have their place, but they fail to provide some crucial elements of communication, such as body language and indications of whose turn it is to speak. Old-fashioned, face-to-face communication may not be of much importance for many organizational tasks, but it is usually essential for activities that have an important social-psychological component, such as negotiating, maintaining relationships, and building trust.

                        最后，应该记住，新的通信技术并不一定会取代现有的技术。 例如，人们可能会认为 20 世纪早期电话使用的增加减少了对传统通信形式的需求，但事实上，情况恰恰相反，因为电话的使用似乎刺激了人们更多面对面交流的愿望，而不是更少。 今天可能会发生同样的事情。 电子邮件和视频会议等新的电子媒体当然占有一席之地，但它们未能提供一些重要的交流元素，例如肢体语言和发言次序的指示。 老式的、面对面的交流对于许多组织任务来说可能不是很重要，但对于具有重要社会心理成分的活动来说通常是必不可少的，例如谈判、维持关系和建立信任。

Every firm depends on a network of suppliers for the new materials, components, and even the ideas that are incorporated into its own products. This is especially true of mature industries, where supplier firms are likely to be the principal source of substantial technological breakthroughs. Without the efforts of outside suppliers to develop and sell innovative products, it is likely that the technological level of many established industries' products would stagnate. Technological changes are therefore shaped not only by the structure and dynamics of individual organizations but also by the pattern of relationships between organizations.

It also demonstrates that interorganizational relationships may act as obstacles to technological advance within the industry. From its earliest years, the automobile industry has depended on thousands of outside suppliers for many of its components—everything from nuts and bolts to complete engines. These suppliers have provided some of the most important technological innovations for the automobile: disc brakes, radial tires, fuel injection, and electronic ignition, to name but a few. These innovations did not sell themselves, however. Before they appeared in automobiles, they had to be bought by the automobile manufacturers (also known as "OEMs," or original equipment manufacturers).

Suppliers were often left in the dark about the actual application of their products; a supplier might not even know which cars used its products or that they were about to be replaced by something totally different. The OEMs did not inform their suppliers about long-range intentions, and as a result suppliers could not effectively plan for the future. Research done by suppliers usually took place without direct consultation with the OEMs, and the job of application came only after the component had been developed. There were few attempts to foster joint efforts between OEM and supplier in order to devise and develop new technologies.

However, faced with stringent competition from automakers in Japan and other countries, in recent years American car manufacturers have begun to initiate joint activities with their suppliers. This is a logical and necessary step for an industry that needs to constantly upgrade the technological level of its products.

                        在 1970 年代和 1980 年代，美国汽车在与日本制造的汽车竞争中表现不佳的主要原因是供应商缺乏参与设计过程，日本制造的汽车更倾向于在汽车开发的早期阶段将供应商纳入设计过程。 然而，面对来自日本等国家汽车制造商的激烈竞争，近年来美国汽车制造商开始与供应商开展联合活动。 对于一个需要不断提升产品技术水平的行业来说，这是合乎逻辑的必要步骤。

                        These cooperative activities stand in sharp contrast to traditional buyer-seller relationships, where both parties are only concerned with their own narrow interests. These relationships work well enough when standard commodities are bought and sold, and price is the paramount concern of the parties to the transaction. In contrast, the development and transfer of new technologies involve unique products and are fraught with many uncertainties. These uncertainties make it difficult to evaluate transactions on a precise cost-benefit basis. Moreover, marketplace exchanges by their nature do not foster the long-term vision necessary for the development and application of modern, sophisticated technologies. As the Japanese experience has indicated, the creation of effective working relationships between separate organizations is an essential element of technological and economic vitality.

                        Technological innovation requires the commitment of personnel, money, and equipment if it is to be successful. It therefore seems logical to expect that large organizations, which are well endowed with these resources, should be the prime sources of technological changes. This expectation has been clearly articulated by John Kenneth Galbraith: "A benign Providence . . . has made the modern industry of a few large firms an excellent instrument for inducing technical change. It is admirably equipped for financing technical development. Its organization provides strong incentives for undertaking development and for putting it to use." For Galbraith and others who hold to this view, the day has long passed when independent inventors and small firms were the prime source of important new technologies. Their place has been taken by the well-financed laboratories and workshops of large corporations and government agencies.

                        On the face of it, this seems reasonable. It is hard to imagine how jumbo jets and mainframe computers could be produced in basement workshops. But the large-scale production of an innovation is not the same thing as its original conception and creation. In point of fact, many important inventions were first conceived and produced by small firms. Only when their technical feasibility had been demonstrated did they become products of large enterprises. Key patents on the turbojet were held by Frank Whittle, an Englishman who produced some of the world's first jet engines in a small workshop that was chronically short of funds and personnel. The first digital computer, the ENIAC, was put together at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert with the assistance of ten engineers. These are not exceptional cases. University research teams, private inventors, and small firms have made crucial contributions to technological advance.

                        Efforts to determine with some precision the connection between organizational size and inventive activity have had mixed results. The assertion that large organizations play a preeminent role in the process of technological advance has not been supported, but neither has it been completely repudiated. Attempts to find a simple correlation (either positive or negative) between firm size and inventive activity are doomed to failure because factors other than size have to be taken into account. Of at least equal importance is the perceived developmental potential of the technologies relevant to an industry's products and operations. It can be reasonably asserted that R&D efforts will be extensive in industries where key technologies are judged to have high potential for further development, and less so when technological prospects appear to be limited. Firms in traditional industries like food and primary metals typically devote only 0.4 percent of their sales revenues to R&D, while firms in the pharmaceutical industry may spend 16 to 20 percent of their revenues on R&D.

                        Even if a correlation between size and inventive activity existed, it would tell us nothing about how effective the research efforts of large firms have been. In fact, it is likely that small firms do a better job of producing new technologies relative to the cost of their research expenditures. Moreover, much of the research conducted by large organizations with secure markets is not oriented toward the production of radically new things but is directed at the creation of modest improvements.Much of it is simply defensive and imitative. Large firms that control a substantial share of their market are more likely to produce inventions that maintain the status quo and to avoid engaging in research that might radically alter the industry in which they already have a comfortable niche. Conversely, small firms or independent units of larger firms have been more successful in creating, developing, and marketing inventions that disrupt the technological status quo.

As we have already seen, the development of new technologies can be a lengthy and expensive process. Large organizations are often better equipped to do development work, where scaling up and making relatively small but nonetheless crucial improvements are the key tasks. This may be their most important contribution to technological innovation. Even so, gigantic size does not appear to be necessary or even beneficial. Large size may be necessary to muster the resources necessary for effective development work, but past a threshold size there appear to be no advantages to bigness.

In some industries such as nuclear power, the bulk of both the research and development work has been done by large firms and government agencies. In other industries, such as smartphone and tablet apps, a great amount of innovative effort has come from individuals and small firms. About the safest statement that can be made is that technological advance requires the efforts of a wide variety of organizational types and sizes. The initiation and development of some technologies require the massive efforts that only large organizations can provide. At the same time, many technologies have been—and will continue to be—the result of the efforts of people working in small organizations or just by themselves.

Their fundamental purpose is to coordinate the efforts of individuals in order to accomplish essential tasks. When routine tasks are involved, this coordination is usually accomplished through the application of basic bureaucratic principles: specialization, formalization (the use of rules, regulations, and standard operating procedures), and hierarchical authority. Although bureaucracies are sometimes thought to be inherently inefficient, there is no reason that they should be. In fact, when it works as it should, a bureaucracy is like a well-oiled machine that faithfully does the job for which it was intended.

As has been noted above, bureaucracies thrive on routine, working best in stable environments where nothing new comes along to disturb their machinelike operations. At the same time, however, these bureaucratic routines are difficult or impossible to reconcile with the inherent uncertainty of creating something new. Furthermore, many unresolved issues surround not just the technology itself but also all of the ancillary changes that may be required to use it effectively. All sorts of uncertainties may be involved in such matters as the acceptance of the technology by customers, the retraining of personnel, legal liabilities, performance of component suppliers, and changing government regulations.

In most cases, activities and projects are closely scheduled and subject to careful financial scrutiny. But innovators usually need a lot of elbow room and have an indefinite time horizon, which puts them at odds with bureaucratic procedures. A large corporation that is organized according to bureaucratic principles can be a difficult environment for inventors. As Jack Kilby, the co-inventor of the integrated circuit, has noted: "There is a basic incompatibility of the inventor and the large corporation. Large companies have well-developed planning mechanisms which need to know at the beginning of a new project how much it will cost, how long it will take, and above all what it's going to do. None of these answers may be apparent to the inventor."

                        As we have seen in Chapter 3, technological innovation is often the work of entrepreneurs. By definition, entrepreneurs are people who disrupt normal activities and procedures by vigorously pushing new ways of doing things. Promoting innovation is risky business, and routine-seeking bureaucratic organizations are generally disinclined to take risks. Not only is a bureaucracy's structure attuned to routine activities, its personnel usually seek to protect their positions and maintain their customary way of life. Under these circumstances, an entrepreneur's efforts to promote innovation within an organization may encounter a fair amount of resistance and even hostility.

The transformative power of an entrepreneur in the face of stiff opposition is well illustrated by an episode in the history of one of the most hidebound institutions in nineteenth-century America, the U.S. Navy. At that time, gunnery was highly inaccurate; of the 9,500 shots fired from American naval vessels during the Spanish-American War, only 121 found their target. No attempt was made to follow a target; gunners used their cannons' elevating gear to give the shell the proper trajectory, fired after the roll of the ship brought the target into their sights, and hoped for the best. Then, during the last years of the nineteenth century, a British naval officer modified the elevating gear of his ship's guns so that they could be rapidly moved, allowing them to continuously track their target. He also modified the gun's telescopic sight so that it wouldn't poke the gunner in the eye when the gun recoiled.

Sims embarked on a personal mission to bring these improvements to American ships. Sims was the quintessential entrepreneur; although he hadn't invented the new system, he was utterly convinced of its value and passionately devoted to seeing it installed. And he was willing to rattle a lot of cages in the course of promoting it. For its part, the Navy acted as a bureaucracy might be expected to act. At first, it ignored Sims' reports on the inadequacies of American gunnery technology and what could be done to improve it. The reports were simply filed away, where they provided a few good meals for the cockroaches that inhabited the file cabinets. When Sims became too insistent to be ignored, the Navy arranged a series of inappropriate tests that "proved" the inadequacy of the new system. Sims finally prevailed only after he succeeded in getting the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt, who installed him in a position that allowed him ultimately to become "the man who taught the Navy to shoot."

There are, after all, many examples of successful working relationships between innovative individuals and the organizations that employ them. Not every organization is structured along classic bureaucratic lines, and as we have already seen, an organization committed to innovation will likely have different structural characteristics than one pursuing routine activities. Still, there is no getting around the fact that organizations may find it hard to accommodate employees who take on the role of entrepreneur. These individuals can be arrogant, stubborn, and single-minded to the point of fanaticism. But at the same time, their vision and energy may be the most important element in their organization's success. To take a recent example, Steve Jobs embodied the positive and negative qualities of the classic entrepreneur. He was an exceedingly difficult person in many ways, but without his vision and guidance Apple Computer would lie buried along with the dozens of defunct personal computer firms that are barely remembered today.

                        Complex societies could not exist without organizations, bureaucratic or otherwise. Organizations are no less important for the initiation, development, and application of most technologies. At the same time, however, inappropriate organizational structures can stifle technological advance. Equally important, the controllers of powerful organizations can select and cultivate technologies that serve only their own interests. This problem is not confined to business organizations; it can also manifest itself in the public sector. Accordingly, we will turn our attention to the biggest and potentially most powerful organization of all: the federalgovernment.

                        The last chapter put forth the claim that organizations play a major role in determining the kind of technologies we get. To be sure, these organizations are not all-powerful. When business firms are involved, consumers can affect technological change by deciding whether or not to buy their products. As employees, we might be able to exert some influence through our acceptance or rejection of new workplace technologies. But not all of the major decisions affecting the trajectory of technological change are made in the private sector. To a large extent, government organizations influence technological choices. In a democratic society, this should expand the power of citizens to get the technologies they want. But do they? Does governmental involvement in the development of technology necessarily result in more beneficial technologies? Are democratic ideals realized in the operation of government policies and processes? These are some of the issues that will be addressed in the following survey of the government's role in shaping technological change.

                        The involvement of the federal government in technological change is as old as the Republic. The United States of America emerged during an era when technological change was beginning to accelerate, and the framers of the Constitution believed that the government should encourage technological advance through the granting of patents and copyrights to those who had produced new things. Accordingly, Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution stipulates that Congress is to "promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the Exclusive Rights to their respective Writings and Discoveries."

                        The government's granting of patent rights provides the legal framework for technological advances generated by individuals and private organizations. The government also supports other types of infrastructure that are essential to the creation, development, and use of modern technologies. Since the ultimate basis of technological advance is the growth of knowledge, governments at all levels do much to indirectly sponsor technological advance through their support of education. Federal aid to individual students has supported the education of large numbers of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Moreover, in recent decades, institutions of higher learning have been major sources of technological advance through their research activities. These activities were strongly encouraged by the passage of P.L. 96-517, commonly known as the Bayh-Dole Act, in 1980. Under its provisions, universities receiving federal research funds that aid in the creation of innovative products and processes can obtain patents on them. Although some universities have reaped substantial revenues from these patents, critics have voiced concerns that the pursuit of these revenues has undermined some of the basic values of the university, such as the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and the free transmission of knowledge. Moreover, the pursuit of patents has not been as lucrative as many have hoped. A few patents have been spectacularly successful from a financial standpoint; the gene-splicing technology developed by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen brought $200 million in revenues to Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco. But patenting has not produced financial windfalls for most institutions; two-thirds of the revenues generated by university-held patents have gone to only 13 institutions.

                        政府授予专利权为个人和私人组织创造的技术进步提供了法律框架。 政府还支持对现代技术的创新、发展、运用至关重要的其他类型的基础设施。 由于知识的增长是技术进步的基础，各级政府都做了很多工作，通过对教育的支持来间接支持技术进步。 联邦对个别学生的援助支持了大量科学家、工程师和技术人员的教育。 此外，近几十年来，高等教育机构通过其研究活动成为技术进步的主要来源。这些活动受到了 P.L. 96-517，通常称为 1980 年的 Bayh-Dole 法案的鼓励。根据该法案的规定，接受联邦研究基金以帮助研发创新产品和工艺的大学可以获得相关专利。 尽管一些大学从这些专利中获得了可观的收入，但批评人士表示，对这些收入的追求损害了大学的一些基本价值观，例如为了知识而追求知识和知识的自由传播。此外，对专利的追求并不像许多人希望的那样有利可图。 从财务角度来看，一些专利取得了惊人的成功； Herbert Boyer 和 Stanley Cohen 开发的基因剪接技术为斯坦福大学和加州大学旧金山分校带来了 2 亿美元的收入。 但专利申请并没有为大多数机构带来经济上的意外收获。 大学拥有的专利收入的三分之二流向了区区家 13 个机构。

                        In addition to maintaining the patent system and supporting education and university research, government programs also provide the auxiliary goods and services that are essential for the use of particular technologies. For example, high-speed air travel requires more than just jet aircraft; equally important are government-supported airports, air traffic controllers, weather forecasts, and safety inspections. To take another obvious example, the effective use of automobiles is dependent on a network of roads and highways, as well as driver training in the schools, the enactment and enforcement of traffic laws, and so on.

                        The case of the automobile brings up another reason for government involvement in technological matters. Every significant technological change brings with it an assortment of auxiliary consequences, some of them pernicious. The private automobile has generated many benefits, but it has also created a number of problems. These problems are not borne exclusively by individual car owners, and for this reason they are known as "negative externalities." That is, they are costs that are not directly taken into account when a person buys a car and puts it on the road; they are external to the market exchange between the buyer and the seller of the car. In operating a car, the owner incurs a number of personal costs: gas, insurance, repairs, and monthly payments that seem to go on forever. But at the same time, the operation of the car results in costs for the society as a whole: increased pollution, congestion, and so on. Since these costs are not included in the market transaction, governmental action is necessary. To take a notable example, the negative externality of automobile-generated air pollution is commonly addressed by regulations that require the installation of emission-control devices. Alternatively, the government could assess an emission tax, thereby making it financially advantageous for an owner to install these devices.

                        汽车的案例提出了政府参与技术事务的另一个原因。每一次重大的技术变革都会带来各种各样的连带后果，其中一些是有害的。私家车带来了很多好处，但也带来了一些问题。这些问题并不完全由车主个人承担，因此被称为"负外部性"。也就是说，它们是人们购买汽车并上路时没有直接考虑的成本；它们在汽车的买方和卖方之间的市场交易之外。在驾驶汽车时，车主会产生许多个人费用：汽油、保险、维修和似乎永远持续下去的每月付款。但与此同时，汽车的运行也会给整个社会带来成本：污染加剧、拥堵等等。由于这些成本不包括在市场交易中，因此需要政府采取行动。举一个值得注意的例子，汽车产生的空气污染的负面外部性通常通过要求安装排放控制装置的法规来解决。或者，政府可以评估排放税，从而使所有者安装这些设备在经济上有利。

                        Some government policies and activities are not aimed directly at technological change, but they can strongly influence its scope and direction nonetheless. Tax policies can affect technological change by encouraging capital investments that often embody new technologies. Capital investment can be stimulated to some degree by taxing the income derived from investments at a lower rate than other sources of income. As a result, individuals and firms are motivated to invest their money in new machines and other productive goods. Capital investment can also be encouraged by allowing the accelerated depreciation of capital equipment. This means that the cost of a machine or other piece of equipment with a useful life of, say, 20 years can be used to offset taxes during a much shorter period. As a result, a firm's immediate profits are increased. Since business executives tend to be primarily concerned with short-term performance, accelerated depreciation can stimulate capital investments that embody new technologies.

                        一些政府政策和活动并不直接针对技术变革，但它们仍然可以强烈影响变革范围和方向。税收政策可以通过鼓励那些拥有新技术的资本投资来影响技术变革。通过以低于其他收入来源的税率对投资所得征税，可以在一定程度上刺激资本投资。因此，个人和公司有动力将资金投资于新设备和其他生产性产品。允许资本设备加速折旧也可以鼓励资本投资。这意味着一台机器的使用年限为 20 年，其成本可用于抵扣一段更短时间内的税收。这样做的结果是，公司的直接利润增加了。由于企业高管往往首要关注短期业绩，加速折旧可以刺激体现新技术的资本投资。

                        The government can also encourage the development and use of specific technologies by offering tax credits or deductions to those willing to invest in them. For many years the federal tax code provided an important benefit for oil producers by granting a depletion allowance that was used to offset corporate taxes. One result was the expansion of petroleum-based energy technologies. A different approach was taken during the 1970s when the energy crises of that period generated a strong interest in alternative sources of energy. One governmental response was to offer generous tax credits to people investing in wind-powered electrical generators, and as a result large numbers of wind turbines have been built in some areas.

                        政府还可以通过向愿意投资特定技术的人提供税收抵免或扣除来鼓励开发和使用特定技术。 多年来，联邦税法通过授予用于抵消公司税的损耗津贴为石油生产商提供了重要的好处。 结果之一是扩展了以石油为基础的能源技术。 在 1970 年代，当时的能源危机引发了人们对替代能源的浓厚兴趣，当时采取了不同的方法。 政府的一项回应是向投资风力发电机的人们提供慷慨的税收抵免，因此在一些地区建造了大量的风力涡轮机。

                        As we have seen, innovation does not always respect existing social and legal arrangements, and the courts may be called upon to resolve issues generated by technological change. To take one example, until fairly recently biological parenthood was not a problematic concept; every child had a father and mother who jointly contributed to his or her conception. Since 1978, however, it has been possible to use in-vitro fertilization for this purpose. This practice has led to a number of legal conundrums centering on the definition of parenthood. One such issue has arisen as hundreds of men have had their sperm frozen for future artificial insemination because they suffered from a terminal disease, were soldiers about to be deployed to a combat zone, or simply as a precautionary measure. Some of these men did in fact die prior to a successful insemination and birth, giving rise to this question: Were their children entitled to the Social Security benefits that are paid to children whose father has died? In Florida, one man's widow filed for benefits on behalf of twins that had been born after her husband's death. The agency denied her claim, only to have the decision overturned by an appeals court. But in 2012 the United States Supreme Court unanimously overturned the lower court's decision because Florida barred inheritance for posthumously conceived children. But this is not the end of the matter. Although four states bar posthumously conceived children from receiving inheritances, the laws of 13 other states allow it. The remaining states lack specific laws regarding posthumous inheritance.

Issues such as these will become even more prominent in the future as advances in reproductive technologies alter the essential nature of parenthood and family.

                        In addition to dealing with the consequences of emerging technologies, the federal government is directly involved in the generation of some of these technologies through its support of research and development. The scope of government involvement in R&D has grown massively in the postwar era. In 1940, the federal government spent only $67 million on the direct support of science and technology, the equivalent of about $1.03 billion today. For the 2010 fiscal year, the federal budget for R&D was about $147.1 billion.

                        Over the last few decades, government involvement in research has been skewed in favor of defense and space exploration. By the time of the last lunar landing, in late 1972, the Apollo program entailed expenditures of $19.4 billion, about $115 billion in today's dollars. More recently, the cost of the construction of the International Space Station came to about $100 billion dollars over a 12-year period, and its operation absorbs about $1.5 billion annually. In the 1984 fiscal year, a massive peacetime military buildup resulted in military R&D expenditures of $31.8 billion, almost 70 percent of the total federal R&D budget. The waning of the Cold War resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of R&D funds allocated to defense. Even so, the military R&D budget for the 2010 fiscal year came to more than $82 billion, about 55 percent of the total federal R&D budget.Moreover, since 9/11 the federal government has greatly increased antiterrorism research and development. Support for technologies aimed at foiling terrorist attacks has increased significantly, as has R&D for code breaking. The extent of funding for the latter is classified, but it is known that the National Security Agency, the highly secretive organization that oversees this research, possessed the world's fastest computer in 2009 and is sponsoring the construction of an even faster one today. The raw data for these supercomputers will come from everything from personal e-mails and telephone records to bookstore purchases and travel itineraries, all of it intercepted and aggregated in a complex being built in Utah that will be five times the size of the U.S. Capitol.

In the 2010 fiscal year the federal budget for civilian R&D was $66.3 billion, with health and human services and energy accounting for $31.2 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. All in all, by supplying about half of the funds used for the nation's R&D efforts, the federal government plays a very large role in the sponsorship of the nation's R&D. In turn, the allocation of federal R&D funds can significantly influence the direction of technological advance. To take a notable example, from fiscal year 2003 to 2012the federal government spent a total of nearly $40 billion on energy R&D. Of that sum, 25.4 percent went for fossil fuel R&D, and another 25.9 percent went to nuclear R&D, while R&D funds for energy efficiency and renewable energy accounted for 16.4 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.

                        Why has government involvement in technological development increased to such a marked degree in the postwar era? In part it is due to the recognition that our prosperity is tied to our ability to advance technologically. Given the fierce competition of the international economy, the failure to maintain high technological levels can have severe consequences. Japan recognized this fact, and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, now METI, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry) aggressively sponsored the development of selected high-technology industries such as semiconductors, genetic engineering, robots, and composite materials. Not only had it provided research funds, MITI also organized cooperative joint research efforts between firms in the same industry so that they could do collectively what they could not do individually.

                        为什么政府在战后时代对技术发展的参与增加到如此显着的程度？ 部分原因是人们认识到我们的繁荣与我们的技术进步能力息息相关。 鉴于国际经济的激烈竞争，技术落后会产生严重后果。 日本认识到这一事实，其通商产业省（MITI，现为经济产业省）积极支持半导体、基因工程、机器人和复合材料等选定高科技产业的发展。 不仅提供研究经费，通商产业省还组织同行业企业之间的合作联合研究工作，使他们可以集体做他们不能单独做的事情。

                        The government of the United States has been less explicit in its sponsorship of technological advance, but it still has played a major role. The development of computers and semiconductors during the early 1950s was extensively supported by federal funds for research and development. Equally important, government procurement of the resulting products created a market at a time when sales within the private sector did not seem promising. In similar fashion, government procurement of aircraft engines and other components provided a strong stimulus for technological advances that spilled over into commercial aviation. Military needs were of course the main source of these efforts. Accordingly, it can be argued that during the postwar era the United States has had a de facto policy of supporting technological development, but unlike Japan, much of it has been driven by military rather than commercial considerations.

                        美国政府在赞助技术进步方面的作用没有那么明确，但它仍然发挥了重要作用。 1950 年代初期计算机和半导体的发展得到了联邦研发基金的广泛支持。 同样重要的是，在私营部门销售不乐观的时候，政府采购为产品的诞生创造了一个市场。类似地，政府采购飞机发动机和其他部件为技术进步提供了强有力的刺激，这些进步已经延伸到商业航空领域。 军事需求当然是这些努力的主要来源。 因此，可以说，在战后时代，美国实际上有支持技术发展的政策，但与日本不同的是，其中大部分是出于军事而非商业考虑。

                        Important though they are, military requirements are not the sole justification for government support of technological advance. Although the market system has served as midwife to an abundance of innovative technologies, it cannot be expected to stimulate every type of technological innovation. Certain kinds of technological advances have little appeal to individual entrepreneurs, for they cannot be "packaged" for sale to individual consumers. Moreover, once these technologies are in place, they presumably benefit everyone, whether they pay for them or not. This is the so-called free rider problem. For example, some people may be ardent supporters of a cleaner environment, but if they were to individually pay for a power plant's smokestack scrubbers, everyone in the community would benefit equally, even though most of them made no financial contributions to the installation of the scrubbers. Under these circumstances, the government has to take the lead by mandating the development and installation of emission-control equipment or assessing a pollution tax that stimulates their installation. The costs would be borne by the operators of the power plant, who would likely pass them along to consumers in the form of higher utility bills. Alternatively, the government could subsidize the installation of scrubbers, and offset the subsidy by levying a tax.

                        尽管很重要，但军事要求并不是政府支持技术进步的唯一理由。 虽然市场体系已经成为了大量创新技术的助产士，但不能指望它刺激每一种技术创新。 某些类型的技术进步对个体企业家几乎没有吸引力，因为它们不能被"包装"出售给个体消费者。 此外，一旦这些技术到位，无论他们是否付费，它们都可能使所有人受益。 这就是所谓的搭便车问题。例如，有些人可能是环境保护的热心支持者，但如果他们要为发电厂的烟囱洗涤器单独付费，社区中的每个人都将平等受益，即使他们中的大多数人没有为安装洗涤器提供任何资金。在这种情况下，政府必须带头强制开发和安装排放控制设备，或评估刺激安装的污染税。 成本将由发电厂的运营商承担，他们可能会以更高的水电费的形式转嫁给消费者。 或者，政府可以补贴洗涤器的安装并通过征税来抵消补贴。

                        Some activities produce benefits that are considerably greater than the returns that accrue to the individuals or firms that engage in them In contrast to negative externalities, these can be labeled "positive externalities." In some cases, the potential social benefits may be great, but the private rate of return may be so small that no private party is willing to undertake them. This is frequently the case with basic research that has no direct payoff but provides a foundation for subsequent technological applications. Moreover, once the research has been done, the knowledge gained can be made available to everyone at little additional cost, thereby increasing its benefits to society as a whole. Under these circumstances it makes sense for the government to sponsor basic research, paying for it through taxation. This is precisely what has happened: 57 percent of the "pure" scientific research conducted in the United States is financed by the federal government and an additional 26 percent is funded by universities and other nonprofit agencies.

                        A modern nation's economic and military security is closely tied to its ability to generate and absorb new technologies. At the same time, simply coping with all of the consequences of technological change can require the leadership and organization that only government can provide. For these reasons, many governments have established special departments and ministries charged with the promotion, control, and governance of technology. But this has not been the case in the United States. There is no cabinet-level Department of Technology, only a collection of congressional committees and government agencies that involve themselves in a plethora of separate issues and decisions. Some of these agencies reside within the executive branch as parts of cabinet-level departments (such as the Department of Energy's Nuclear Regulatory Commission), while others (such as NASA and the National Science Foundation) are quasi-independent agencies directly under the president.

                        The executive branch is best situated to bring some degree of coherence to technology policy, and in fact the president and his staff have on occasion played significant roles in determining the course of a particular technology by influencing legislation, designating agency heads, impounding funds, and using the other tools available to the president. The importance of having the president well advised on scientific and technological matters was recognized in 1957 with the formation of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) within the Eisenhower administration. PSAC was largely concerned with matters relating to defense and space, and when its members failed to support President Nixon's policies on missile defense and the construction of a supersonic airliner, PSAC was abolished in 1973 and some of its functions were transferred to the National Science Foundation. A formal structure for providing scientific and technical advice for the president was reconstituted in 1976 with the formation of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The director of OSTP also serves as a member of the National Science and Technology Council, which was established by a 1993 executive order of President Clinton. In addition to the OSTP director, the council includes the president, vice president, and several cabinet-level officials and high-level administrators. Among its responsibilities are coordinating the science and technology policy-making process, making science and technology policies and programs consistent with the goals of the administration, and furthering international cooperation in science and technology. It is also the domain of the Chief Technology Officer, a position created by President Obama in 2009 and whose efforts have been directed toward making the government more effective and accessible through the use of current technologies.

                        Some presidents have had more interest in science and technology policies than others, but direct presidential involvement in the shaping of these policies has been infrequent in all administrations. On a few occasions, however, it has been highly significant. President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (the "Star Wars" ballistic missile defense system) represented a major redirection of American defense policy, yet it began as an idiosyncratic effort. The president publicly announced the program only five days after informing his science adviser, while the joint chiefs of staff, the secretary of state, and the secretary of defense got only two days' notice. The chief scientist for the Pentagon learned of the proposal only nine hours before the speech that presented the program to the nation.

                        With presidential involvement in the setting of technology policy largely confined to a few major policy decisions, the day-to-day shaping of technological policy tends to be the business of Congress and various government agencies. Here, the disjointed nature of American technology policy is apparent. There is no unified approach to the budgeting of funds for research and development: over a dozen appropriation subcommittees in each house of Congress take a hand in determining the budgets of the agencies they oversee. These committees and subcommittees often have to address issues directly connected to technological matters. Congressional involvement with technological issues was recognized in 1972 by the creation of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which had as its purpose the provision of information to Congress to help guide its decisions about technological policy, and to give it more leverage over the president in science and technology matters. OTA investigated a wide selection of topics that ranged from an examination of the physiological basis of drug addiction to an evaluation of the Social Security Administration's plans to upgrade its computer facilities. In its early years OTA was criticized for not taking on highly controversial topics, but it eventually became involved in contentious matters like the effectiveness of a proposed antimissile defense system. In the latter case, the publication of its report was delayed by a lengthy classification review, and in the end several key chapters were deleted due to the objections of the Defense Department. It is likely that the Defense Department's opposition had more to do with the negative tone of the report than with concerns about its revelation of military secrets.

Given the contentiousness of many technological issues and the frequent difficulty of separating facts from values, OTA was in an inherently precarious situation. Being on the "wrong side" in some controversial issues undercut OTA's support in Congress, especially after Republicans gained control of both houses in 1994. Despite strong bipartisan agreement on the value of OTA outside Congress, the office was dismantled a year later. Its demise seems to confirm the old joke that powerful individuals and groups tend to use expertise the way that a drunk uses a lamppost—more for support than for illumination.

                        The most direct way that Congress determines the course of technological development is through passing laws that either forbid the use of a particular technology or regulate the way it is used. Indeed, the very notion that the government has a legitimate right to regulate private industry originated with the need to address a problem presented by a new technology—the explosion of riverboat steam boilers in the first half of the nineteenth century. The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia was given the task of investigating the construction and operation of boilers. Its report provided a wealth of information about boilers and their components, as well as a set of recommendations regarding their operation and maintenance, many of which were subsequently written into law by Congress. Today, government regulations cover a vast number of technological concerns, everything from the siting of nuclear power plants to the length of trucks.

                        Along with the passage of laws and regulations, the federal government affects the course of technological development through the budgetary process; that is, by deciding to pay for certain kinds of technologies and not others. In some cases, government financial support can be crucial. The supersonic transport plane (SST) literally never got off the ground because in 1971 Congress voted not to appropriate any more funds for its development. Also, as we have seen in Chapter 8, the George W. Bush administration severely restricted stem-cell research that used human embryos. Conversely, some technologies, such as civilian nuclear power, have received a large amount of financial and legal support from the federal government that has been crucial to their development and use.

It often happens that technologies are sponsored because they have substantial outside support. Gaining government interest in addressing a technological issue is a crucial first step, and one that cannot be taken for granted. Here again, the piecemeal approach to governing technological change is evident. There is no clear and comprehensive approach to deciding what technological goals should (and should not) be pursued so that a governmental agenda can be set. Instead of being the product of calm deliberation, an issue is often put on the agenda because of some "focusing event"; an oil embargo forces a consideration of the energy technologies we use; the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union demonstrates the apparent need for an accelerated U.S. space program; a serious accident reveals material and organizational defects in the operation of nuclear power plants.

But large-scale protests are more likely to emerge when a new technological possibility lies just over the horizon. Technologies that have already been established, whatever their unfortunate consequences, simply do not generate the kind of concerns that new ones do. Cars, along with giving us our prized freedom of mobility, also befoul our environment, encourage ugly sprawl, and in 2010 killed nearly 33,000 people in the United States, the equivalent of a major commercial airline crash every two days.

                        当社会运动针对特定技术时，也会出现危机感和采取果断行动的需要。 一些社会运动已经采用了成熟的技术，这些技术在成为媒体曝光的主题之前一直未被关注，特别是用于开采石油和天然气的水力压裂或"压裂"。 但是，当新技术的可能性即将出现时，更有可能出现大规模抗议。 已经建立的技术，无论其带来的不幸后果如何，都不会像新的技术那样产生担忧。 汽车给我们带来了宝贵的行动自由，同时也污染了我们的环境，助长了丑陋的蔓延，2010 年在美国造成近 33,000 人死亡，这相当于每两天发生一次大型商业航空公司坠毁事故。 然而，很少有人考虑将它们置于更严格的政府监管之下，甚至完全废除它们。

                        Only a few technologies have generated much popular opposition. Such diverse technologies as the chlorination of water, the extensive use of medical X-rays, microwave ovens, and birth-control pills have received, at best, passing attention, and no sustained effort to subject them to governmental control. In fact, it is not entirely clear why some technologies and not others become the focus of widespread concern. But it is certainly true that a technology that produces large-scale failures, such as a nuclear reactor accident, is more likely to evince opposition than one that produces a series of small-scale failures, even though in aggregate their consequences may be great, as has been the case with automobiles. And it is also the case that media exposure can greatly heighten opposition to a technology with evident problems. Again, this sort of exposure is more likely when the failure is large and spectacular rather than diffuse and important only in the aggregate.

                        Examples of widespread public debate over new technologies are infrequent; most innovations emerge with little public attention. But this does not mean that politics has been irrelevant. As noted earlier, many new technologies owe their development and diffusion to sponsorship by particular governmental agencies. Since there is no centralized approach to the governance of technology, many key decisions are made at the middle levels of government, that is, by government agencies and congressional committees. It is here that decisions are made to sponsor a particular technology and to create the conditions necessary for its success. Technology policy is the sum of many separate policy actions undertaken at this level. Under these circumstances, the ambitions of individual governmental agencies and their administrators can determine the course of technological development, for an agency has a strong interest in pushing technologies that are in accordance with its own goals, and having them adopted as national policy.This is often achieved with little fanfare. Most decisions about technological policy do not generate much political heat, and a government agency may successfully promote a particular technology with little or no public discussion or debate.

                        关于新技术的广泛公开辩论的例子并不常见； 大多数创新的出现几乎没有受到公众的关注。 但这并不意味着政治无关紧要。 如前所述，许多新技术的发展和传播归功于特定政府机构的赞助。 由于没有集中管理技术的方法，许多关键决策是在政府中层，即政府机构和国会委员会做出的。 正是在这里做出赞助特定技术并为其成功创造必要条件的决定。技术政策是在这一层面采取的许多独立政策行动的总和。 在这种情况下，各个政府机构及其管理者的野心可以决定技术发展的进程，因为一个机构对推动符合自身目标的技术并将其作为国家政策采用具有浓厚的兴趣。 这通常是在不张扬的情况下实现的。 大多数关于技术政策的决定不会产生太多的政治热度，政府机构可能会成功地推广一项特定的技术，而很少或根本没有公开讨论或辩论。

                        The importance of government sponsorship can be seen in the history ofatomic power in the United States. In the mid-1950s, the electrical utilities, the greatest potential users of nuclear power, had little reason to make use of the new technology. According to one utility company president, "We weren't anxious to get into nuclear power, and I don't think any other company in its right mind wanted to get into it either." To overcome this reticence, the key government agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, engaged in a large-scale selling job. A demonstration plant was built at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, in 1954, and technical assistance was offered to the industry, along with subsidized prices for nuclear fuel. This is not to say that the Atomic Energy Commission's actions were illegitimate or that civilian nuclear power owes its existence solely to government support, but it does show how national policy can be shaped by the interests of a particular government agency.

                        政府资助的重要性可见于美国的原子能发展史。 在 1950 年代中期，作为核能最大潜在用户的电力公司几乎没有理由利用这项新技术。 一位公用事业公司总裁表示，"我们并不急于进入核电领域，我认为其他任何心智正常的公司也不想进入核电领域。" 为了克服这种沉默，主要的政府机构原子能委员会进行了大规模的销售工作。 1954 年在宾夕法尼亚州希普林波特建造了一座示范工厂，并为该行业提供了技术援助以及核燃料的补贴价格。 这并不是说原子能委员会的行为是非法的，或者民用核能的存在完全归功于政府的支持，但它确实表明国家政策可以如何受到特定政府机构的利益的影响。

                        Since some government agencies are more powerful than others, their programs forge ahead while other agencies' projects languish. As a result, potentially significant programs are not enacted, or if enacted they are chronically underfunded, while more dubious ones move ahead. A few agencies are more influential than others because of the greater technical abilities of their staff and their greater interest in science and technology. But in many cases what really matters is who their clients are. Government agencies do not operate in splendid isolation; they are often closely tied to a particular set of clients. As we have seen with the Federal Communications Commission in Chapter 13, even when the task of the agency is regulation, it may be "captured" by the industry that it is supposed to regulate. This happens because the agency needs the support of the industry it oversees in order to maintain its legitimacy and resources. An agency may even delegate to the industry some of the regulatory tasks that it is charged with performing. For example, much of the inspection work performed before the Federal Aviation Administration certifies the airworthiness of a new airplane is actually done by engineers and technicians in the employ of the plane's manufacturer.

                        由于一些政府机构比其他机构更强大，他们的项目往往拥有更高的优先级。 结果是，一些可能的重要计划没有颁布，或者即使颁布了，它们也会长期资金不足，而更多可疑的项目则继续推进。 少数机构比其他机构更有影响力，因为其员工的技术能力更强，并且对科学和技术更感兴趣。 但是在很多情况下，真正重要的是他们的客户是谁。 政府机构并非孤立地运作； 它们通常与一组特定的客户紧密相关。正如我们在第 13 章中与联邦通信委员会所见，即使该机构的任务是监管，它也可能被它应该监管的行业"捕获"。 之所以发生这种情况，是因为该机构需要其监管的行业的支持，以维持其合法性和资源。 一个机构甚至可以将它负责执行的一些监管任务委托给行业。 例如，在美国联邦航空管理局认证新飞机适航之前进行的大部分检查工作实际上是由受雇于飞机制造商的工程师和技术人员完成的。

                        The close involvement of government agencies with powerful clients often results in the support of technologies that favor these clients. A great deal of government-sponsored agricultural research has focused on productivity improvements that require mechanization and generally high capital investments. Such research has benefited large, wealthy farmers most of all, and it has even contributed to the decline of small farms and the displacement of rural labor. But large farmers provide the bedrock of political support for the Department of Agriculture, and as a result this agency has primarily sponsored technological developments that benefit its most important and powerful clientele. It has been argued that government-sponsored technological development in general has been strongly oriented to the support of centralized, capital-intensive industries; the result, according to some critics, has been unemployment, environmental damage, increased energy consumption, and greater economic concentration.

                        If an industry has a strong interest in a particular technology, it may exert a great deal of influence, so Congress and the relevant government agencies will lend their support to that technology. In turn, members of Congress may find a particular technology to be politically attractive because it offers "pork barrel" benefits to their constituents. Some technologies, especially those in the military sector, have forged ahead because a project has contractors and subcontractors in a large number of congressional districts. Members of Congress quite naturally are likely to support programs that provide jobs and other economic benefits for their states and districts, and are willing to support projects that benefit the constituents of other representatives in return for support of projects that benefit their own.

                        In sum, as with many other government policies, the direction of technological policy often results from the interaction of an "iron triangle" of congressional committees, government agencies, and the key groups whose interests are closely affected by governmental decisions. The decision to sponsor a new technology, along with the shape that it takes as it is developed, is often determined by these triangles. This means that the government usually doesn't sponsor the development of new technologies as part of a general effort to find solutions to public problems. Rather, a technology is sponsored because a coalition can be formed from the members of the triangle, who see to it that the selected technologies develop in accordance with their own needs and interests.

                        It also happens that once under way, the development of a new technology builds up momentum. The personnel and agencies charged with its development have a strong interest in its continuation, as do potential users. As a result, a technological policy gets locked in place and options are closed off. In the absence of outside pressures, projects are destined to move ahead. Even when a technology has manifest problems of considerable magnitude, the sponsors of the technology will tend to "throw good money after bad," for once the commitment has been made and the program is underway, it often is far more difficult to terminate a program than to continue with it.

                        This is one of the greatest defects of our system of governing technology. Technological change is an uncertain process, with many unforeseeable consequences. Efforts to forecast the precise consequences of a new technology so that policies can be constructed in advance to deal with them are doomed to failure. The best that can be hoped is that technologies can be stopped or modified if this should prove necessary. This is easier said than done. The effective governance of technology is faced with a fundamental paradox: change is easiest at the beginning, but this is when the need for it cannot be foreseen. As Ernest Fitzgerald, the whistle-blower we briefly met in Chapter 18, has said of military projects, "There are only two phases to a major program. The first phase: 'It's too early to tell.' The second phase: 'It's too late to stop.' "

                        In this way, technology appears to be out of control, as many technologies seem to be driven by their own momentum. But this is not really what is happening; seemingly out-of-control technologies move ahead because they suit the real interests of individuals and organizations. Were these to be taken away, there would be far less reason to continue with the development or deployment of the technology. Technologies do not simply stand or fall on their own merits; their success or failure can often be attributed to the political support that they receive. And this political support will likely be a reflection of the distribution of power both inside and outside the corridors of government. Under these circumstances, is there any hope that an unorganized citizenry can have any influence over the way technology develops? It is to this, our last topic, that we will next turn.

Most of us have been little more than the consumers of technologies that have been developed by people and organizations largely unknown to us. This process has produced spectacular successes and spectacular problems. Technology has extended our lives, lightened some of our burdens, increased our wealth, and kept us amused. At the same time, the advance of technology has left us with some very unpleasant by-products. This is not the place to attempt to determine if the good has outweighed the bad, for so much depends on what we value. Which way of living is preferable: that of the !Kung San, with its relaxed work patterns but material impoverishment and limited control of the environment, or our own, with its abundance of goods and knowledge, but frantic work schedules? In any event, for most of us the choice is moot; unless we decide to become nomadic hunter-gatherers or subsistence farmers, our lives will be lived in a world shaped by modern technology. At issue is not the acceptance or rejection of technology; what matters is how much individual influence we have over the choice of technologies that we use now and will use in the future.

As we have seen in the first chapter of this book, there is not a great deal of anguish about our reliance on modern technology. Then, too, it must be remembered that democratic participation has its costs. Above all, the expansion of the number of people engaging in technological decision-making can disrupt the orderly processes favored by managers, engineers, and bureaucrats. This follows from the simple arithmetic of participation; the more parties there are to a decision, the harder it is to decide. The result is often a stalemate—"my vote cancels yours." Everybody ends up with veto power, but no one is able to act in a positive fashion. At best, the result is compromise, which may be a reasonable conclusion in some areas, but in matters that require decisive action, such as stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction or significantly mitigating global warming, a compromise decision may be worthless or even dangerous.

Can democratic participation be reconciled with technological advance? Before these questions can be answered, it is obviously necessary to have some workable definition of democracy. A vast amount of thinking and writing has gone into this issue, and we cannot presume to break any new ground here. But most of us could agree that a democratic process is one in which the people as a whole are able to participate in making meaningful choices about the things that affect their lives. The capitalist economic system does contain some democratic elements, for consumers can choose to buy or not buy particular products, and in so doing they affect the course of technological change. There has been a "democratic" affirmation of hybrid cars, but not of battery-powered ones. And certainly consumer choice has dictated the shift to smaller cars whenever gasoline prices shoot up. But these are choices made after the fact. Consumers can choose only between existing alternatives; they cannot determine which alternatives will be made available to them. This is a bit like voting in a referendum; the electorate can decide an issue, but it does not determine which issues are put on the ballot in the first place.

                        In similar fashion, democratic choice can be exercised by voting for or against candidates because of their stance on a key technological issue. There have been local elections that have hinged on a candidate's position on the fluoridation of water or on nuclear power, but these have been rare. Elections are usually fought over a variety of issues; technological policy has been but one, and usually a minor one at that. And even where a technological issue is at the center of a campaign, the voters' voices are heard only after a technology is already in place, as with referenda on nuclear power. There is virtually no popular input into whether or not completely new technologies should be developed. In this sense, democratic controls are at best reactive.

                        民主选择可以因为候选人在关键技术问题上的立场而被投票支持或反对。 曾经有的地方选举的核心议题是关于候选人在水氟化或核电方面的立场，但这种情况很少见。 选举通常是围绕各种问题展开的。 技术政策只是一个，且通常是次要的。 即使在竞选活动的核心是技术问题，也只有在技术已经到位后才能听到选民的声音，就像核能公投一样。 对于是否应该开发全新的技术，几乎没有普遍的意见。 从这个意义上说，民主控制充其量只是被动的。

                        Is it possible to have democratic control of technology that goes beyond these after-the-fact votes? In some ways, the advance of technology has increased the potential for democratic participation in government. Most importantly, the electronic media have heightened our awareness of political issues. It has often been remarked, for example, that the widespread protests against the Vietnam War were stimulated by the horrible realities of warfare appearing on television day after day. At the same time, however, exposure does not guarantee an enlightened response. As we have seen, the expansion of newspaper reading that was triggered by the invention of the steam-powered rotary press stimulated a great outpouring of jingo-ist sentiment and the fanning of imperialist ambitions in the United States. Finally, many critics have decried the present-day debasement of the political process by slickly produced advertisements for candidates and ballot initiatives. It thus seems that advances in communication technologies have had mixed consequences for the democratic process. The electronic media in general and the Internet in particular hold out the prospect of a more informed electorate, but the positive contributions of these media are often overwhelmed by the negative ones, just as happened with the rise of the popular press generations earlier.

                        除了这些事后投票之外，是否有可能对技术进行民主控制？ 在某些方面，技术的进步增加了民主参与政治的潜力。 最重要的是，电子媒体提高了我们对政治问题的认识。 例如，人们经常说，电视上日复一日地出现可怕的战争画面，刺激了对越南战争的广泛抗议。 然而，与此同时，暴露并不能保证一个开明的反应。正如我们所看到的，由蒸汽驱动的轮转印刷机的发明引发的报纸阅读量的扩大，刺激了沙文主义情绪的大量涌现，并在美国煽动了帝国主义的野心。 最后，许多批评者通过为候选人和投票计划制作巧妙的广告来谴责当时政治进程的堕落。 因此，通信技术的进步似乎对民主进程产生了复杂的后果。 一般而言，电子媒体，尤其是互联网，让选民变得更加知情，但这些媒体的积极贡献往往被消极贡献所淹没，就像早先几代大众媒体的兴起一样。

                        Advances in electronic media have also presented the possibility of direct democracy through a kind of electronic town hall. Instead of delegating decisions to elected officials, every citizen could use an Internet site to vote on the pressing issues of the day. Such a system is certainly technologically feasible, but is it a practical possibility? Security questions aside, could voters be expected to be sufficiently well-informed to pass judgment on everything from levels of farm price supports to the wisdom of supplying arms to a revolutionary movement in some far-off land? And even if such a system were implemented, would it really result in a truly democratic order? It is obvious that people could not vote on every single issue, so some kind of rationing would have to be instituted. Some agency would have to determine what got on the "ballot" in the first place, and this would be a source of power in itself. The ability to set governmental agendas—the determination of which issues make it into the political arena—is a crucial political decision, and this system would do nothing to democratize this process. All voters could do would be to make choices according to a preplanned agenda.

                        Given the limitations of direct democracy, we necessarily have to rely on some form of representative democracy. Unfortunately, the established institutions of representative democracy in the United States have not always guided technological development in ways that serve the public interest. The key political actors have been especially responsive to large, well-organized bodies, such as industries, labor unions, and other special interests. All too often the common good is lost to the special pleadings of these groups. Compounding the problem is the fact that the political process is fragmented, which allows government agencies and officials to cut deals with special interests while no one looks after the needs and concerns of the nation as a whole. Under these circumstances, government officials end up representing themselves and their powerful constituents rather than the people who voted them into office.

                        Does this mean that there is no hope that individual citizens can affect the course of technological change? Despite what has just been said, there is some room for optimism, and there are numerous occasions when democracy can assert itself in technological affairs. Democracy may work best when issues are close to home. To note two recent examples, concerns about their effects on local environments have motivated well-organized protests over fracking and the construction of an oil pipeline passing through the Midwest. In contrast, many pressing but seemingly far-off technological issues do not engage the interest of people distracted by their individual problems of raising a family, meeting mortgage payments, or studying for exams. Burdened with mundane daily problems, it is all too easy for us to deny that there is an urgent need to do something about nuclear proliferation or climate change. The perception that immediate, local concerns are being affected by technological change can therefore energize greater levels of public perception than is the case when the issues seem too large and remote to concern us. There is considerable wisdom in the slogan that enjoins us to "think globally and act locally."

                        这是否意味着公民个人没有希望影响技术变革的进程？ 尽管刚才说了这些，但仍有一些乐观的余地，而且在很多情况下，民主可以在技术事务中发挥作用。 当问题离家很近时，民主可能会发挥最佳作用。 举两个最近的例子，因对当地环境影响的担忧引发的对水力压裂和穿过中西部的石油管道建设的组织良好的抗议。相比之下，许多紧迫但看似遥远的技术问题并没有引起人们的兴趣，他们因养家糊口、支付抵押贷款或学习考试等个人问题而分心。 背负着平凡的日常问题，我们很容易否认迫切需要对核扩散或气候变化采取行动。 因此，与问题看起来太大而遥远而无法关注我们的情况相比，技术变革正在影响直接的本地问题的看法可以激发更高水平的公众看法。 "放眼全球，本土行动"的口号中蕴含着相当多的智慧。

                        It must be admitted that local politics is uninteresting to many people, as the usually low levels of voter turnout for local elections attest. Moreover, participation at the grassroots level faces the same limits as other kinds of political participation; involvement can be time-consuming and stressful, and people would prefer to leave the tasks of governance to local officials. But at the same time, involvement in technological policies that have a direct impact on one's own community can reduce apathy and lethargy. And it might also be the case that expanding democratic participation and tying technological issues to local concerns would result in the emergence of technologies significantly different from those produced by our present system.

                        Finally, while our governmental structures and processes have produced some technologies of very questionable value, we should also realize that no system of guiding technology will guarantee a utopia. No matter how advanced or benign our technologies, human life will always have its insecurities, disappointments, and tragedies. It can even be argued that it is dangerous to seek perfection in both our technological and political systems. There is something inhuman about a society that cannot tolerate the fact that life does not always go according to plan. The invention and development of new technologies have been characterized as ongoing searches for the "best way," and elegantly satisfactory solutions to technological problems do emerge on a regular basis. But most of life is not like that. We will always have to reconcile ourselves to the fact that even the most advanced and responsive technologies will not solve many of our basic problems. As we have seen, the spectacular advances of many individual technologies should not blind us to the fact that some of the inherent difficulties of life are simply not amenable to technological solutions.

The course of technologicaldevelopment has produced many surprises, and it will continue to do so. Fifty years ago few would have foreseen the emergence of smartphones with the power of existing mainframes. Yet at about the same time it was confidently predicted that nuclear generating plants would produce electricity "too cheap to meter." Forecasting is a highly inexact art, and although it can be safely said that our lives will be strongly influenced by technological change, predictions beyond this general statement are fraught with hazards.

We don't have to resign ourselves to the inexorable advance of technology while passively hoping that it produces more good than harm. Technology remains a human creation, and we have it in our power to determine its future course. Unfortunately, the power to make this determination is very unevenly distributed through society. A major reason for this unequal distribution of power is the unequal distribution of knowledge. This is especially unfortunate because a knowledgeable citizenry has always been essential to the functioning of democracy. In the words of Thomas Jefferson, "If we think [the people] not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion." The expansion of citizens' knowledge is even more crucial than it was in the days of Jefferson, when most adults worked as farmers and humans had never traveled faster than the speed of a horse. The relentless advance of technology has produced a dizzying pace of change that at times leaves us gasping. Even so, it bears repeating that technology is our own creation, and that its ultimate source is knowledge. But for technology to be truly beneficial, more than technical knowledge is required. Our challenge will be to develop and apply many different kinds of knowledge—ethical, philosophical, sociological, political, and economic—so that we can do a better job of defining our real needs and creating the technologies that serve them.

                        然而，仅仅因为这些事情是可能的并不意味着他们应该去做。 我们不必让自己屈服于无情的技术进步，而被动地希望它产生的好处多于伤害。 技术仍然是人类的创造，我们有能力决定其未来的发展方向。 不幸的是，做出这一决定的权力在整个社会中分布非常不均衡。 造成这种权力分配不均的一个主要原因是知识分配不均。 这尤其令人遗憾，因为知识渊博的公民一直对民主的运作至关重要。 用托马斯杰斐逊的话来说，"如果我们认为 [人民] 不够开明，无法以健康的自由裁量权来行使他们的控制权，那么补救措施不是从他们那里夺走它，而是告知他们的自由裁量权。"公民知识的扩展甚至比杰斐逊时代更为重要，当时大多数成年人从事农业工作，而人类的旅行速度从未超过马的速度。 技术的无情进步产生了令人眼花缭乱的变化步伐，有时让我们喘不过气来。 即便如此，还是有必要重申技术是我们自己的创造，其最终来源是知识。 但要使技术真正受益，需要的不仅仅是技术知识。 我们的挑战将是开发和应用许多不同类型的知识——伦理、哲学、社会学、政治和经济——以便我们能够更好地定义我们的真正需求并创造服务于他们的技术。

                        Four years on, food price volatility persists. In their latest report on global food insecurity, FAO attempts to ask the question whether this volatility in food prices will continue into the future. Its conclusion is that as populations continue to rise and economic prospects improve, there will be a pressure on demand leading to increased prices. In addition, FAO warns that a range of other factors will combine to create a complex situation contributing to the volatility. For example, if the frequency of extreme weather events increases, interruptions to food production in key producing countries will be more frequent. Oil price increases can also increase the attractiveness of biofuel alternatives which in turn will also contribute to raising food prices.

                        From the circumpolar perspective, this persistent volatility in global food prices is significant because it serves to highlight a range of developments and trends which are impacting on Inuit access to affordable and nutritious foods - both traditional foods as well as store bought goods. Food security in the Arctic has been a longstanding issue and has its genesis in a range of driving factors - not just cost. These include geography, pollution of country foods by contaminants, the impact of climate change and economic vulnerability.

                        Since 2005, a number of factors have combined to bring about a sharp increase in prices across a range of food and feed staples. While steep and often short-lived price increases had occurred in previous decades, the situation has been marked by substantial and simultaneous hikes across a broad range of commodities. By 2008, the international prices of all major food commodities had reached in real terms the highest they have been in 30 years. By 2010, the volatility varied between the commodities with world prices for wheat and maize doubling in the second half of 2010 and and the first half of 2011 while rice prices were relatively stable after a tumultous period of price rises in 2007.

Long- and short-term drivers - population growth, changing lifestyles, climate change and the growing use of food crops for biofuels - may be shifting the world into a period of more volatile and sustained high prices. The consequences, particularly for the most vulnerable communities, may be harsh."

                        Against this backdrop of global trends in food security are the specific issues which have particular resonance for Inuit across the Arctic, although in varying degrees. The variations are due in part to the different economic and policy positions in each of the four countries that make up the Arctic Inuit homeland. Also settlement patterns vary across the Arctic. Results from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) showed that in Greenland, most indigenous people live in cities (places with populations over 10,000) or towns (populations between 1,000 and 7,000). In Chukotka and northern Alaska, most live in villages with populations less than 1,000. In Canada, most indigenous people live in towns.

                        Political and economic contexts aside, the impacts of climate change and the consequential effects on snow and ice are already being felt in small communities throughout the circumpolar north. Among the most significant of these impacts are "health and nutritional concerns (related to the availability of country food) associated with changes in the abundance and migratory patterns of subsistence resources." In other words, the food situation across the Arctic is increasingly affected by a range of extraneous factors whose effects are being felt very strongly at the local level.

Many of the issues identified at the workshop were similar to those set out in the earlier paper.

A price survey conducted by the Canadian department of Indian and Northern Affairs in 2006 and 2007 in 49 isolated northern communities showed that a food basket which would provide a nutritious diet for a family of four for one week costs between C$350 and C$450. The same basket cost between C$195 and C$225 in southern Canada. Subsequent surveys by the department in 2009 showed similar disparities between southern centres and the north.7

Rather, subsistence products are directly consumed by the harvesting household, given away, or exchanged. Cash plays an important role in the Alaska mixed economy however. Money buys snow machines, gas, and ammunition. The time spent in wage work may conflict with time that otherwise would be spending harvesting subsistence resources. In Greenland, in contrast, licensed professional hunters account for a large portion of the harvest of traditional foods. Households purchase these products in local open-air markets or processed in supermarkets. Greenlandic households are, with some restrictions, also allowed to hunt and fish for the consumption of their own household. Despite differences in the structure of the mixed economy, these are measures of the extent to which the components of a mixed economy are present in the Arctic."

Traditional foods were widely consumed and were a highly valued component of the diet. But the survey also showed that economic constraints limited access to traditional foods because of the high cost of fuel and other hunting expenses. Further to the high cost of fuel, "the cost of Greenlandic [traditional] food is influenced by supply, as determined by quota restrictions, environmental conditions and animal accessiblity" which increase the market value and reduce affordability.

                        In Russia, a different trend has emerged. During the Soviet era, Chukotka's Inuit were compelled to eat the ubiquitous and often mass produced Soviet food. The pressure was such that traditional foods were often only eaten in secret. Hunting rifles were discouraged in this Cold War region while collective enterprises such as fur farms and dairies were encouraged. Whales were no longer hunted by the locals but rather large government boats would catch gray whales and deliver them from village to village. A local hunter economy was replaced in a matter of two decades by a centrally-planned economy.

The fresh and dried fish; the fat, oil, or meat from beaver, beluga, caribou, moose, oogruk, polar bear, and walrus [...] all had so far escaped contamination."

                        Of particular concern was the way in which a wide spectrum of substances - persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, and radionuclides - were reaching unexpectedly high levels in the Arctic ecosystem. The reason for these very high levels is linked to the special characteristics of the Arctic ecosystem. Marine mammals, which are a substantial part of the Inuit traditional diet, rely on fat reserves for energy and insulation against the cold. It is also a fact that the contaminants biomagnify up the food-chain. Most marine mammals are predators, and with each step up the food chain, the chemicals are more concentrated, until they reach the very high levels. Conversely, marine fish and animals which are lower down the food chain will have lower contaminant levels. POPs, because of their chemical properties, concentrate in fatty tissues and when consumed, the high levels of contaminants stored in these tissues are transferred to humans. The result is that in some parts of the Arctic, levels of contaminants in blood and breast milk are higher than those found anywhere else in the world.

                        In the meantime, the international community has been working to reduce, and if possible eliminate, contaminant emissions. The European Community created the first international legally binding instrument aimed at reducing air pollution in 1979 in Geneva. The resulting Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) entered into force in 1983. It has been extended by eight specific protocols, among them the Protocol on POPs and the Protocol on Heavy Metals, both of which entered into force in 2003. In 2001, with a strong role of the Canadian Government and aboriginal organizations (led by ICC), 114 countries signed the Stockholm Convention on POPs.

But it has also been found by several studies that a number of contaminants (e.g. mercury and some newly emerging POPs) are not decreasing in the environment and need immediate international action. With the emergence of the new POPs, it is increasingly difficult to keep up with the changing threat of contamination. Difficulties include the development of new methods to reliably measure the new chemicals and to evaluate which chemicals need to be scanned for. Several thousand different chemicals are being continuously released into the environment and determining which ones are of particular concern and need to be monitored is a diffcult task.

They report that species they rely on are disappearing and that hunting routes near shorelines have disappeared due to erosion brought on by the thawing of permafrost. Villages have experienced increased flooding in winter due to lessened or disappearing pack ice that normally protects shorelines.

                        Food security is inextricably linked to a person's ability to exercise his or her right to food. That right is included in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family (sic) including food" (Article 25).

                        The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recognized the importance of food security for indigenous peoples - not just from a calorific perspective but also from the broader socio-cultural perspective. In its paper on The Right to Adequate Food, the significance of food and its accessibility is acknowledged as being "inextricably grounded in …socio-cultural traditions and [the] special relationship to ancestral territories and resources. Food and its procurement and consumption are often an important part of their culture, as well as of social, economic and political organization. For Inuit, this linkage between food and culture is inextricable.

                        Also important in the context of the right to food is the States obligation to protect the right to food. For Inuit across the Arctic, this is particularly relevant in terms of the level of chemically contaminated traditional foods. In this, OHCHR points out that States have to protect the right to food against against violations by third parties. "For example, States should prevent third parties from destroying sources of food by, for instance, polluting land, water and air with hazardous industrial or agricultural products or destroying the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples". As noted earlier, this area of contaminants is one in which ICC has taken a leading role internationally to bring about changes to international regulations and governance surrounding the production of contaminants which threaten the Arctic and its wildlife.

                        在食物权方面同样重要的是国家有义务保障食物权。 对于北极地区的因纽特人来说，这与传统食品受到化学污染的程度尤其相关。 在这方面，人权高专办指出，各国必须保护食物权免受第三方侵犯。 "例如，各国应防止第三方破坏食物来源，例如用危险的工业或农产品污染土地、水和空气，或破坏土著人民的祖传土地"。 如前所述，在这一污染物领域，ICC 在国际上发挥了主导作用，以改变有关威胁北极及其野生动物的污染物生产的国际法规和治理。

                        In considering food security in Inuit communities as a broader issue, it is important to remember that access to food isn't simply a technical issue. As spelled out clearly in the Rome Declaration which came out of the 1996 World Food Summit, there are integral links between food security and human rights. "Democracy, promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, and the full and equal participation of men and women are essential for achieving sustainable food security for all."

                        在将因纽特人社区的粮食安全视为一个更广泛的问题时，重要的是要记住，获得食物不仅仅是一个技术问题。 正如 1996 年世界粮食首脑会议发表的《罗马宣言》中明确指出的那样，粮食安全与人权之间有着不可分割的联系。 "民主、促进和保护所有人权和基本自由，包括发展权，以及男性和女性的充分和平等参与对于实现所有人的可持续粮食安全至关重要。"

                        Realization of this right to food is a responsibility shared by all, from families and communities through to national governments and international organizations. Existing national and regional responses to support that right include programs such as Canada's Northern Contaminants Program. National and state legislation which ensures Inuit with the appropriate rights to traditional hunting, fishing and gathering activities is another appropriate way to protect Inuit food security for nutritional, cultural and economic reasons. Similarly the international community has a responsibility to ensure indigenous rights are not nullified as a consequence of international agreements.

ICC already makes significant contributions in representing Inuit interests in international organizations tackling challenges including climate change and other environmental issues of pressing importance such as Arctic marine pollution and contaminants all of which are impacting on the Inuit right to food.

                        Another important contribution by ICC is the work undertaken to ensure that Inuit traditional knowledge is considered in the international efforts to underpin biodiversity particularly in the Arctic. The link between biodiversity and food security is well recognized and was reconfirmed in the 1996 Rome Declaration. ICC's work in the UN Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) processes offers a valuable opportunity to contribute the Inuit knowledge and skills to the ongoing effort to conserve and protect biodiversity. A fundamental consideration in all of this work is that hunting is vital for Inuit not just for health and dietary reasons but also for the health of Inuit culture.

                        Food security or rather food insecurity continues to be a major priority for ICC's consideration and action. That action is undertaken on several fronts - through United Nations forums to push for frameworks and international legislation that regulate the production and distribution of contaminants; through international human rights bodies to ensure that the Inuit right to adequate food is protected; through regional and international environmental organizations to highlight the impact of climate change on the Arctic and its consequences for Inuit food security; and through national as well as international bodies to protect Arctic biodiversity which underpins Inuit health and wellbeing. As the international community's concerns about the future of global food security persist, so too does ICC's concerns about how this translates into the food security situation for Inuit across the Arctic. As a result, food security will remain a top priority for ICC action.
