                        Technology is of no use unless it is put to use. This is a crushingly obvious statement, but it does serve to remind us that a technology that never makes it out of a laboratory or an inventor’s basement might just as well not exist. The last two chapters have examined some of the ways in which technologies have come into being; the task of this chapter is to describe how they are adopted by the individuals and organizations that actually put them to use. Our concern here is the diffusion of technologies—that is, the processes through which they spread from their initial sources into homes, factories, offices, and so forth. To begin, we will consider the diffusion of technologies from one country to another. In the second part, the focus will narrow as we look into the process of technological diffusion at the level of the individual business firm.

                        如果技术不投入使用，那么它就没有用处。这看似显而易见，但它确实提醒我们，如果一项技术无法走出实验室或其发明者的地下室，那么它和从未存在过也没有区别。前面的两个章节研究了技术产生的一些方式；而本章的任务是讲述这些技术如何被个人或组织使用的。我们在此关注的是技术的扩散——也就是说，技术从它们最初的源头传播到每个家庭、工厂、办公室的过程。这其中的第一部分，我们将讲述技术从一个国家到另一个国家的传播。在第二部分中，我们的焦点将会缩小到个体商业公司的技术传播过程。

                        There is an understandable human tendency to believe that progress, technological or otherwise, is largely the result of efforts of one’s own people. We exalt native scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors, and see in their efforts the major source of our technological advance.The Soviet Union in the Stalin era carried this to ridiculous lengths when Soviet historians claimed that their countrymen had invented everything from the steam engine to baseball, but many other countries have exhibited strains of technological nativism.The truth of the matter is quite different. Although indigenous skills and achievements are an indispensable part of technological advance, few technologically dynamic countries have been isolated from the influences of other lands. Continued technological advance requires an infusion of ideas, tools, and materials from other places, coupled with an ability to make good use of them.

                        人们经常理所当然地认为技术、或其它领域的进步，基本上都是自己人努力的结果。我们称颂本国的科学家、企业家和发明家，并将他们的努力视为我们技术进步的主要来源。斯大林世代的苏联将这种倾向发挥到了一个可笑的高度：苏联历史学家曾声称苏联人发明了从蒸汽引擎到棒球在内的所有东西。不过许多其它国家也表现出了对技术本土主义的热衷。事情的真相其实大相径庭。金光本土技术及成就是技术进步不可或缺的一部分，但很少有技术活跃的国家能够独立于世界其它地区的影响。持续的技术进步需要从其他地方汲取创意、工具和材料，并能够充分利用它们。

                        Consider the world in the year 1500. There can be little doubt about what country had produced the most technological innovations up to that time. It was not England, nor was it France, Italy, or Germany. The country with the greatest heritage of inventive achievements was China. By 1500, Chinese technologists had produced not only the compass, paper, and gunpowder—the familiar textbook examples of Chinese inventive ability—but also had been responsible for such inventions as the segmental arch bridge, the chain drive transmission, the spinning wheel, watertight bulkheads for ships, printing, fishing reels, paddlewheel boats, the differential gear, earthquake detection devices, and of course the fine porcelain that takes its name from its country of origin. Europe too could claim some significant technological advances, most notably in mining and cathedral building, but on the whole, there could be little question where the greater degree of inventiveness had been residing.

                        让我们回到1500年的世界。要问那个时候哪个国家产生了最多的技术创新？不是英国，也不是法国、意大利或德国，而是中国。1500年时，中国的技术人员不仅制造了指南针、纸张和火药——教科书中人们耳熟能详的例子——还发明了拱桥、链传动、纺车、水密船舱壁、印刷、渔线轮、桨轮船、差速器、地震仪等装置，当然还有以其为名的精美瓷器。在此期间，欧洲也取得了一些重大技术进步，比如在采矿和大教堂建设等方面，但总的来说，中国的技术创新程度要要的多。

                        Yet within less than two centuries China’s lead had dissipated, and the European continent exhibited the greater degree of economic and technological vitality. Much of this dynamism could be attributed to the successful adoption of Chinese inventions by European countries. Paper was an essential complement to printing; together they made possible the rapid circulation of new ideas and stimulated the growth of literacy, which in turn directly contributed to major historical changes such as the Protestant Reformation and the spread of capitalism. The magnetic compass greatly aided transoceanic navigation and allowed the spread of European economic power throughout the world. And gunpowder helped to conquer and secure that world for the benefit of Europe.

                        然而在不到两个世纪的时间里，中国的领先优势就消失了，欧洲大陆表现出更大程度的经济和技术活力。这种活力在很大程度上可以归因于欧洲国家成功采用中国发明。纸张是印刷的重要补充；他们共同促成了新思想的快速传播，促进了识字率的增长，进而直接促成了新教改革和资本主义传播等重大历史变革。磁罗盘极大地帮助了跨洋航行，并使欧洲经济实力在世界范围内传播。而火药帮助欧洲征服世界并维护了其利益。

                        The successful use of foreign technologies in early modern Europe was very much in accordance with long-standing historical patterns. Many of the most significant inventions used by the Western world up to that time did not originate there. The stirrup, which initiated major changes in medieval warfare and in so doing reshaped the social system, was not a Western invention, but diffused from Persia sometime after the eighth century, although it too probably originated in China. Horses could not be used effectively as draft animals until a practical collar diffused from Asia to Europe in the eighth century.

                        在近代欧洲早期成功使用外国技术与其长期存在的历史模式非常一致。那时西方世界使用的许多最重要的发明并非来自本土。马镫在中世纪战争中引发了重大变化并由此重塑了社会制度，它不是西方的发明，而是在8世纪之后的某个时候从波斯传播的，尽管它也很可能起源于中国。直到八世纪实用的项圈从亚洲传播到欧洲，马才能有效地用作役畜。

                        Much of the economic dynamism and prosperity of the Western world therefore can be traced to the willingness of its people to accept and make good use of technologies that originated elsewhere. By contrast, China was far less open to foreign inventions. Secure in the belief that they inhabited the “Middle Kingdom”<span class="notation">(the literal translation of Zhong Guo, the name by which the Chinese called their country)</span>, the Chinese looked at the outside world with more than a trace of condescension. This attitude was particularly evident when China came into contact with the expansionary nations of Europe. During the late eighteenth century, English merchants and officials scoured the world in search of customers for the products of English factories, but they found no takers in China. The emperor made it very clear to one envoy of King George III that “there is nothing we lack. . . . We have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects, nor do we need any more of your country’s manufactures.”

                    <span class="chi">
                        因此，西方世界的大部分经济活力和繁荣都可以追溯到其人民愿意接受并善用源自别处的技术。相比之下，中国对外国发明的开放程度要低得多。中国人相信他们居住在“中央王国”<span class="notation">（“中国”二字的中文直译）</span>，中国人看向外面的世界带着一丝傲慢。当中国与欧洲的扩张国家接触时，这种态度尤为明显。 18 世纪后期，英国商人和官员在世界各地为其产品寻找客户，但这些商品在中国无人问津。皇帝向国王乔治三世的一位使节明确表示，“我们什么都不缺。 . . .我们从来不为奇怪的商品上开设商店，我们也不需要你们国家的制造品。”

                        China’s ruling elite persisted in this attitude. Toward the end of the nineteenth century the scholar Kang Youwei advocated the combination of Western techniques with traditional Chinese culture. Although he won the support of the emperor, the reform movement that was initiated in 1898 was aborted in a few months when the emperor was deposed and replaced by the reactionary dowager empress, Dzu Xi. The early years of the Chinese Republic<span class="notation">(1912–1949)</span> saw a considerable infusion of Western ideas and technologies, but these were eclipsed by Chiang Kai-shek’s New Life Movement, which stressed a return to Confucian virtues as the cure for China’s weakness.

                        Even the emergence of a Communist state in 1949 did not result in a whole-hearted acceptance of foreign ideas and ways of doing things. Although a considerable amount of technology transfer from the Soviet Union took place during the early 1950s, the Chinese were offended by Russian arrogance. The political rift between the two countries closed off China’s main source of advanced technology, while at the same time, Maoist ideology contributed to an increasing aloofness to the outside world and stressed self-reliance in technological matters. Only in recent decades has China exhibited an openness to the outside world. In the words of one Chinese journalist, “No nation has a monopoly on culture. Cultural exchanges between nations are inevitable and irresistible. . . . Whatever will facilitate China’s material modernization and its cultural advancement is welcomed.”

                        In contrast, people and business firms in the United States have a long history of borrowing technologies that originated elsewhere. One could practically date the start of America’s industrial revolution to the year 1790, when Samuel Slater, who had recently emigrated from England, used his accumulated knowhow to construct the first successful mechanized spinning factory in the United States. In the years immediately following, the United States was so deficient in indigenous technological capability that many implements and techniques had to be imported. American canal builders found it necessary to secure from England drawings and examples of devices as simple as a wheelbarrow in order to successfully construct early canals.

                        These were not simply instances of a young and economically immature nation relying on imported technologies due to temporary incapability. Modern, quintessentially “American” innovations such as automobiles, radios, jet airplanes, compact discs, and the World Wide Web all owe their existence to pioneering efforts that were undertaken in other lands. And along with imported implements, materials, and processes, American technological development has been spurred on by an even more valuable import: people. Although a large reservoir of “Yankee ingenuity” cannot be denied, many of America’s greatest technological achievements were produced by immigrants. It would take many pages simply to list some of the most prominent of these, but a small sample can illustrate the debt that American technology owes to immigrant scientists, inventors, and engineers. One of the first plastics, Bakelite, was the work of a man born and educated in Belgium, Leo Baekeland. The mathematical and engineering work of Charles Steinmetz, a transplanted German, was essential to the development of the American electrical industry. The science of aerodynamics owes much of its early development to an immigrant from Hungary<span class="notation">(via Germany)</span>, Theodore von Karman. The television camera was invented by a Russian exile, Vladimir Zworykin. This pattern continues today. According to one study, between 1995 and 2005 more than a quarter of new engineering and technology firms had foreign-born founders, CEOs, or chief technology officers, as exemplified by Sergey Brin of Google and Pierre Omidyar of eBay. Equally important, inventors and entrepreneurs, both immigrant and home-grown, have benefited from the services provided by legions of unsung men and women who brought their skills from other lands and in so doing helped to push American technology to new heights.

                        这些不仅仅是一个年轻且经济不成熟的国家由于暂时的无能而依赖进口技术的例子。现代的、典型的“美国”创新，如汽车、收音机、喷气式飞机、光盘和万维网，都归功于在其他国家进行的开拓性努力。随着工具、材料和工艺的进口，美国的技术发展受到了更有价值的进口的刺激：人。尽管不可否认有大量“洋基匠心”，但美国许多最伟大的技术成就都是由移民创造的。仅列出其中一些最突出的内容就需要很多页，但一小部分样本可以说明美国技术欠移民科学家、发明家和工程师的债务。最早的塑料之一，Bakelite，是在比利时出生并接受教育的 Leo Baekeland 的作品。移居的德国人查尔斯·斯坦梅茨 (Charles Steinmetz) 的数学和工程工作对美国电气工业的发展至关重要。空气动力学科学的早期发展很大程度上归功于来自匈牙利的移民<span class="notation">（来自德国）</span>，西奥多·冯·卡曼。电视摄像机是由俄罗斯流亡者弗拉基米尔·兹沃雷金发明的。这种模式今天仍在继续。根据一项研究，1995 年至 2005 年间，超过四分之一的新工程和技术公司的创始人、首席执行官或首席技术官在外国出生，例如谷歌的谢尔盖·布林和 eBay 的皮埃尔·奥米迪亚。同样重要的是，移民和本土的发明家和企业家都受益于大量无名男女提供的服务，他们从其他国家带来了他们的技能，并因此帮助将美国技术推向了新的高度。

                        A heavy reliance on foreign technologies also can be seen in the development of another technological colossus, Japan. The aggressive industrialization effort launched after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 was at first based on the importation of foreign equipment such as locomotives and textile equipment. Foreign technical advice was also avidly sought; during the early years of the new emperor’s reign, the salaries of foreign technicians absorbed 6 percent of the central government’s budget, and 40 to 50 percent of the budget of the Ministry of Industry for the duration of its existence.

                        As Japan’s industrial enterprises began to emerge, their products were often outright copies of foreign products. At times, Japanese attempts to copy foreign artifacts produced comic results, as exemplified by the factory with a sawtooth roof that faced the wrong way so no light shone through the windows, or the tailor who stitched together a Western-style suit complete with a patch on the pants. But with mounting experience, Japanese workers and managers were able to effect substantial improvements until some of their products were the equal of Western manufactured goods. An early example of this was the Toyoda automatic loom, which in 1929 was exported to a textile mill in England, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. Certainly no one laughs at Japanese technology today, although the accusation is occasionally still made that the country excels in the refinement of existing technologies but produces few completely new ones.

                        Today, a considerable amount of technology transfer occurs when firms in the economically advanced nations of the world establish factories in developing countries, some of them engaged in the manufacture of highly sophisticated electronic equipment such as computers and smartphones. For critics, the appeal of these offshore enterprises centers on the availability of cheap labor; their output consists of assembled products that require few skills on the part of the assemblers. As a result, these enterprises are little more than enclaves of modernity with few if any connections to the host country’s economy and society. In contrast, a more optimistic assessment of these enterprises stresses their positive role in stimulating the development of workers’ skills and technological advance. Governments that are committed to economic and technological advance know that labor gets more expensive as a country develops and workers demand their share of a rising national income. Under these circumstances, low-cost labor ceases to be a nation’s main advantage. Consequently, countries like Taiwan, Korea, and China<span class="notation">(as well as Japan in an earlier era)</span> have made concerted efforts to upgrade the skills of their labor forces, so the quality of their labor forces makes up for the higher wages paid to workers. No less important, these countries—China especially—have used multinational firms as sources of up-to-date technologies by requiring the transfer of these technologies as preconditions for allowing these firms to set up shop on their soil. And although it is hardly a commendable business practice, many firms, especially Chinese ones, have gained a fair amount of technological knowhow through outright piracy.

It is not an easy matter to copy a technology that was produced somewhere else. Having an example of a machine or a material in front of you helps, but it hardly guarantees success. Life would be simpler and easier if technological advance were simply a matter of importing a prototype and then engaging in “reverse engineering.” It does work occasionally, but all too often the process ends in frustration, as when the Chinese government reportedly spent $300 million in the 1980s in a failed attempt to produce a workable copy of the Boeing 707 jetliner.

                        The very nature of technology makes copying a difficult enterprise. As was stressed in earlier chapters, technologies have to be considered as systems, and if one element is missing or deficient, even seemingly simple tasks such as copying a particular item may be impossible. A successful technology transfer requires numerous complementary inputs, many of which have to be developed and produced by the recipient. There are occasional possibilities for “leapfrogging” over whole stages of development through the importation of foreign technologies. For example, in many parts of the world, cell phones have given millions of people access to telephone service by eliminating the need for an expensive wired infrastructure. But this is an exception; more often than not, the successful use of advanced imported technologies depends on the preparation that comes through involvement with well-established technologies.

                        技术的本质使复制成为一项困难的企业。 正如前几章所强调的，技术必须被视为系统，如果一个元素缺失或不足，即使是看似简单的任务，例如复制特定项目，也可能无法完成。成功的技术转让需要大量补充性投入，其中许多必须由接受者开发和生产。通过引进外国技术，偶尔会有在整个发展阶段“跨越”的可能性。例如，在世界的许多地方，手机消除了对昂贵的有线基础设施的需求，让数百万人获得了电话服务。但这是一个例外；通常情况下，成功使用先进的进口技术取决于参与成熟技术的准备工作。

                        This brings us to a related point. The effective use of foreign technologies requires a labor force with a broad range of skills. It is essential that native managers, engineers, technicians, and ordinary workers are capable of making the best of opportunities that imported technologies present. To do so often entails significant modifications to an imported technology. Under these circumstances, the application of imported technologies is combined with indigenous innovative efforts to the point where the two are in fact part of a single process.

                    <span class="chi">
                        这引出一个相关论点。即有效利用外国技术需要具有广泛技能的劳动力。本土管理人员、工程师、技术人员和普通工人必须能够充分利用进口技术所带来的机会，这一点至关重要。这样做通常需要对进口技术进行重大修改。在这种情况下，进口技术的应用与本土创新努力相结合，两者实际上是一个过程的一部分。

                        A successful user of imported technologies must therefore have a reasonably high level of indigenous capability. As noted by Vernon Ruttan, “The ability to screen, borrow and adapt scientific knowledge and technology requires essentially the same capacity as is required to invent new technology.” This is demonstrated by one study that found that the countries most successful in using foreign technologies tended to be the ones with high levels of indigenous research and development. It is also significant that countries with the highest innovation rate make the quickest use of technologies developed elsewhere. A country<span class="notation">(or an individual firm)</span> that draws on technologies developed elsewhere is spared the expense of “reinventing the wheel,” but making effective use of imported technologies—even if only direct copying is required—often requires a stock of indigenous skills that cannot always be easily found.

                        In some cases the diffusion process may result in a technology emerging as something fundamentally different. This is exemplified by the aforementioned transfer of gunpowder from China to Europe. The Chinese at first regarded gunpowder as a medicinal substance, and only after hundreds of years of experimentation did they begin to employ it for fireworks and on occasion for military rockets, bombs, and mines. By the end of the thirteenth century the Chinese were using gunpowder to fire projectiles from vase-shaped guns, but development seems to have stopped at this point. A few decades later, Europeans began using gunpowder for weapons of steadily increasing destructive power, thereby transforming the nature of warfare and ultimately society as a whole.

                        在某些情况下，扩散过程可能会导致技术出现根本不同的情况。前面提到的火药从中国转移到欧洲就是例证。中国人起初将火药视为一种药材，经过数百年的实验，他们才开始将其用于烟花，有时还用于军用火箭、炸弹和地雷。到13世纪末，中国人开始从火铳中发射弹丸，但此时的发展似乎已经停止。几十年后，欧洲人开始将火药用作破坏力不断增加的武器，从而改变了战争的性质，最终改变了整个社会。

                        The changes made in the course of the diffusion of gunpowder from China to Europe were monumental, for the nature of the technology changed along with the purposes to which it was put. In most cases, however, the modifications are far less dramatic. A process of “fine tuning” takes place as the technology is transferred from one place to another. As has been noted above, many successfully diffused technologies succeed only because of alterations and improvements made during the process of diffusion. Some of these changes may be done in order to adapt an imported technology to local conditions. In the late nineteenth century, Japanese entrepreneurs set up textile factories that used ring-spinning machines that had been invented in Europe. Unlike in Europe, however, these machines were supplied with a combination of high-quality long-staple cotton and cheaper short-staple cotton. The thread that was produced was lower in quality, but it was less expensive, an important consideration in a nation that was still poorer than most European countries. Another adaptive change occurred when the railroad, an English invention, crossed the Atlantic. Railroad systems were built in the United States with great haste because there were huge expanses of frontier to be opened up as quickly as possible. One consequence of these conditions was that curves were much sharper than in England. This in turn necessitated changes in locomotive design, as American engines were equipped with pilot wheels placed ahead of the driving wheels to guide them through the curves.

                        火药从中国传播到欧洲的过程中发生了巨大的变化，因为技术的性质随着它的目的而改变。然而，在大多数情况下，修改远没有那么引人注目。当技术从一个地方转移到另一个地方时，就会发生一个“微调”的过程。如上所述，许多成功传播的技术之所以成功，只是因为在传播过程中做出了改变和改进。其中一些变化可能是为了使进口技术适应当地条件。19 世纪后期，日本企业家建立了使用欧洲发明的环锭纺纱机的纺织工厂。然而，与欧洲不同的是，这些机器提供的是优质长绒棉和更便宜的短绒棉的组合。生产的线质量较低，但价格较低，这在一个仍然比大多数欧洲国家贫穷的国家中是一个重要的考虑因素。另一项适应性变化发生在大西洋彼岸使用英国发明的铁路的时候。铁路系统在美国兴建起来非常仓促，因为要尽快开放大片的边境。这样的后果之一是美国铁路弯道的弧度比英格兰的要大得多。这反过来迫使机车改变设计，使得美国发动机配备了位于驱动轮前面的导向轮，以引导它们通过弯道。

                        The early development of the Japanese steel industry provides another illustration of a successfully diffused technology that required many adaptations wrought by native workers and technicians. Although the Japanese had been making small batches of high-quality steel for centuries, their indigenous industry was incapable of making iron and steel in large quantities. Japanese steelworkers therefore looked to Europe for better ways of producing steel. The first Japanese attempts to draw on foreign techniques occurred in the 1850s when they attempted to produce cannons by using methods described in a Dutch book on steel production. Success was slow in coming. Numerous trials resulted in the production of cannon that burst the first time they were fired. Yet underlying these failures was a highly useful learning process. At first, the native iron workers were incapable of melting even half of the required pig iron, but by the fifth attempt a complete cannon was cast, albeit not with complete success. Still, even this limited achievement required strenuous efforts to learn how to treat the raw material and to develop devices and techniques to bore the barrel of the cannon. Within about 20 years of the original attempt, the foundry had successfully cast approximately 200 cannons. In accomplishing this, the cannon founders had been able to draw on indigenous capabilities in such things as the production of fire bricks for use in the reverberatory furnace in which pig iron was melted, the construction of water-powered boring machines, and the employment of high temperature furnaces for melting the iron.

                        日本钢铁工业的早期发展提供了另一个成功传播技术的例证，该技术需要本地工人和技术人员进行许多调整。虽然日本人几个世纪以来一直在小批量生产优质钢材，但他们的本土工业却无法大批量生产钢铁。因此，日本钢铁工人向欧洲寻求更好的钢铁生产方式。日本第一次尝试借鉴外国技术发生在 1850 年代，当时他们试图根据荷兰一本关于钢铁生产的书中描述的方法生产大炮。成功来得很慢。无数次试验导致大炮在第一次发射时就爆裂。然而，这些失败背后是一个非常有用的学习过程。起初，当地的铁匠连所需生铁的一半都无法熔化，但到了第五次尝试时，虽然没有完全成功，但还是铸造了一门完整的大炮。尽管如此，即使是这种有限的成就，也需要付出艰苦的努力来学习如何处理原材料以及开发装置和技术来为大炮的枪管钻孔。在首次尝试的大约20年内，铸造厂成功铸造了大约200门大炮。在这一过程中，大炮铸造者们使用了日本本土技艺，例如生产用于熔化生铁的反射炉的耐火砖、建造水力钻孔机以及使用用于熔化铁的高温炉。

                        Although their efforts represented an attempt at imitating foreign products and techniques, more was involved than mere copying. What began as an effort to imitate foreign techniques ended successfully only when indigenous capabilities were applied to the solution of production and design problems. The process continued in 1880 when foreign engineers were recruited to oversee an ambitious effort to increase steel production. Initially this too was a failure, largely because the foreign experts did not take into account the special characteristics of Japanese coal and iron ore. But even this failed attempt to produce steel through the importation of foreign materials and experts ultimately met with success 12 years later when a Japanese engineer and one of his students reopened the dormant blast furnace after solving the problems created by the use of native coke and iron ore.

This example shows that technological diffusion is not a one-way process; without active participation by the recipients of the foreign technology, an imported technology may end up an expensive failure. In turn, effective participation often is the product of previous efforts at indigenous technological transformation. The issue is not one of “imitation” versus “self-reliance,” but of how to achieve an effective blending of the two.

Modifications may have to be made to these technologies, but, on the whole, technologies of foreign origin are a sound basis for indigenous development. This assumption can be challenged by noting that the countries receiving foreign technologies today are not like nineteenth-century Japan and the United States. Most are far poorer, not just in terms of wealth, but also in regard to human skills; this creates numerous problems in effectively using the sophisticated technologies that have been created for the developed nations of the world. Moreover, poor countries have large and growing populations, making the creation of jobs one of their prime needs. Although in recent years the rate of population growth has slowed in many poor countries, there still remains a huge cohort of new entrants to the labor force. As a result, youth unemployment rates are still stubbornly high; according to a recent estimate by the International Labor Organization, 88 million young people around the world are struggling to find a job.

                        Unfortunately, many of the technologies that have been developed in the economically advanced nations have been designed to save labor, not to maximize its use. Labor is often saved by using technologies that allow the substitution of capital for labor, yet one of the distinguishing features of poor nations is that they are critically short of capital. And finally, is it reasonable to expect that the world as a whole can sustain the global diffusion of the technologies that have been developed by the rich nations of the world? It is hard to imagine China or India consuming resources at the rate the United States does. To take one notable example, China at the end of 2010 had an approximate ratio of one car per 17.2 persons, about one-tenth the ratio in the developed countries. If China, a nation of 1.4 billion people, were to achieve a car-to-population ratio equal to North America, Europe, and Japan, the prospects for resource depletion and environmental pollution would be grim indeed.

                        Due to the drastically different circumstances of today’s underdeveloped countries, technologies that have worked well in the rich nations where they originated may fail when they are taken to a different setting. Even worse, they may seriously distort the course of a nation’s development and leave it poorer than when it started out by concentrating human and financial resources in a few privileged segments of the economy and society, leaving much of the population, especially those in rural areas, as poor as ever. To take one particularly notorious example, after Western experts introduced large tractors into Pakistan, farm owners replaced farm laborers with the new machines. In one region, 40 percent of these workers lost their jobs and thus were forced to migrate to the cities and lives of dire poverty. Per-acre crop yields hardly increased at all.

Appropriate technologies less directly connected with production include shelters made out of concrete and canvas, solar-powered lights, and inexpensive laptop computers for schoolchildren. The utility of these technologies seems evident, and few could take issue with the general goals of appropriate technology. The difficulty lies in their actual development and implementation. Consider the first goal: increasing employment. As noted earlier, in poor countries there is good reason to select technologies that use relatively more labor than capital. But using labor-absorbing technologies may not result in overall increases in employment. At first glance, small-size sugar mills in India seem to be excellent examples of appropriate technology. In the late 1970s they produced 20 percent of India’s output—1.3 million tons of sugar per year—while providing jobs for more than half a million people. Many jobs were created because the same amount of capital required to build a large modern sugar mill could be used for the construction of forty mini-mills; together these employed ten times more people than the modern mill.

                        Unfortunately however, these apparent employment gains were lost elsewhere in the system. Although the mini-mills produced two and a half times more sugar per unit of capital, they incurred much higher labor costs<span class="notation">(exactly how high depended on wage rates in the small mills compared to the large ones)</span>. This resulted in higher prices, lower profits, government subsidies, or some combination of all three, which in turn prevented funds from entering other sectors of the economy. Were this not the case, there would have been more money to spend on other goods and services, and a consequent stimulation of employment in these industries. Thus, the apparent creation of jobs in small sugar mills in all likelihood produced no net increases in employment.

                        Many economists would argue that a free market system, with its realistic reckoning of capital and labor costs, will naturally result in the use of labor-intensive appropriate technologies. But the choice of technologies is not always governed by economic calculations. Technologies may be selected because they meet the requirements of powerful segments of the society, as when ultra-modern hospital technologies are installed to serve the urban upper class of a country that lacks basic medical services for most of its people.

According to one study of business firms in Indonesia, intermediate technologies resulted in lower costs and equal product quality, but they were often rejected in favor of advanced technologies of foreign origin. This was especially likely to happen in firms that had oligopolistic control over their market. Under these circumstances, the aesthetic appeal of sophisticated technologies and the prospect of managing machines instead of people overrode the economic advantages of more appropriate technologies.

In the final analysis, a technology can be adjudged appropriate or inappropriate only by reference to particular values, and these cannot be defined exclusively in economic or technological terms. The appropriate technology movement also has directed attention to the role played by powerful groups and institutions in the choice of technologies. Choices are likely to be seriously constrained when donors of foreign aid, international lending agencies, and multinational corporations occupy positions of dominance. It is also likely that the emergence of appropriate technologies is seriously hindered by the international distribution of R&D expenditures, only about 16 percent of which is spent in the underdeveloped countries of the world.

At the same time, the transfer of sophisticated technologies from developed countries may cause more harm than good. Choices must be made, and in poor countries as well as in rich ones, the selection of technologies reflects many larger issues. One of the most important of these is sustainability. Today’s technologies have enriched our lives in many ways, but can we continue to degrade the natural environment while also expecting the perpetual availability of energy supplies and other resources? In this context, technologies are appropriate when they save energy, require minimal resources, and relieve stresses on the environment. Examples of sustainable technologies include products that lend themselves to recycling, building designs that require little energy for heating and cooling, and road systems that are safe and convenient for cyclists and pedestrians.

                        Many of the same processes that characterize the diffusion of technology from one country to another also manifest themselves when new technologies are acquired by business firms in the same country. Many factors affect the speed with which new technologies diffuse. According to Christian P. Tanon and Everett M. Rogers, these include relative advantages over existing technology, compatibility with existing values of the firm, the ease or difficulty of understanding and applying the new technology, the ease in experimenting with the new technology or employing it on a trial basis, and the extent to which positive results are apparent. In highlighting the importance of ease of use, observability, and comprehensibility, this list carries the implication that, after all is said and done, it is individual people who determine the success of a technological innovation. The diffusion of technology is still essentially a learning process, through which the recipient gains an understanding of how the technology works while at the same time adapting the technology to the recipient’s particular needs. In this, the activities of skilled people are usually essential. As Mira Wilkins explains, “Often the product, or the description in the patent, or mere drawings and instructions, are inadequate for transfers of technology; [people] are needed to carry, explain, and facilitate the introduction of new processes or products.”

                        When we speak of “people,” we mean special kinds of people. The effective transfer of technology often requires a movement from one environment to another, such as from a laboratory to a factory. Technology is fundamentally a system of knowledge, but knowledge that is readily comprehensible in one setting may be a great mystery in another. As with the conversion of scientific knowledge to technological practice noted in the previous chapter, successful diffusion sometimes requires the services of a kind of “translator”—a person capable of functioning in both settings so that information can be transferred from one to the other.

There was the early work of Heinrich Hertz, who “translated” James Clerk Maxwell’s theories of electromagnetic radiation into a laboratory technology that allowed an empirical examination of the theory. Following Hertz, Oliver Lodge moved beyond the laboratory experiment through his development of an imperfect but workable method of using radio waves for actual communication. The first stage in the development of radio was essentially completed by Marconi, who took the embryonic technology and converted it into a practical<span class="notation">(and highly lucrative)</span> commercial business. Throughout the course of radio’s history, information was put into a new form, pushing the technology to the next stage of development. In Aitken’s summary, “At each stage in the process of translation, information generated in one system was converted into a form that ‘made sense’ in terms of another; and at each stage new information was blended with what was already known to create something essentially new.”

Along with the opportunities presented by a new technology come uncertainties that cannot be assessed through conventional economic analysis. No new technology is a “sure thing.” Some end up embarrassing failures, and even with a technology that is ultimately successful, its immediate advantages may be slight and its benefits may be a long time in coming. On a more positive note, some new technologies may exceed expectations when they are complemented by other technologies. Under these circumstances, new products and processes are more than the sum of their parts, as when a combination of the laser and the computer gave birth to supermarket scanners, printers, and robotic surgery.

Many years may elapse before a technology passes from laboratory feasibility to commercial value, that is, from invention to innovation. Although some inventions made the transition rapidly—only one year in the case of Freon refrigerants—others have taken much more time. In the case of the mechanical cotton picker it was 53 years, and for the zipper,27 years.

Given the nature of technological innovation, uncertainties will rarely vanish completely, but as information is gathered and experience gained, uncertainties can be converted into risks. More than terminology is involved here; according to a distinction made by economists and game theorists, “uncertainty” indicates an inability to predict an outcome, whereas “risk” implies at least a rough notion of the probability of success or failure. The ability to make calculations of this sort does not ensure accurate predictions of success or failure, but at least it enables managers to make informed judgments of their likelihood.

Although any new way of doing things can be presumed to have its share of bugs and other unanticipated problems, these may be minor when compared to the commercial uncertainties of a new venture. Uncertainties of this sort can be particularly problematic, for decision makers usually find it easier to assess the probability of technical success than the probability of marketing success. “Will it fly?” is easier to determine than “Will anybody pay money to fly in it?” This was the literal problem for the Anglo–French supersonic airliner, the Concorde. A stunning technological achievement that required the solution of countless complex problems, the Concorde was a commercial failure. An extraordinarily expensive aircraft to fly and maintain, it never generated revenues commensurate with the costs of its development and operation. No private business could have survived this sort of failure.

The corrosive effects of the NIH mentality were bemoaned by Henry Ford II:“There’s too much NIH—not invented here [in the automobile industry]. . . .

As was noted, innovation is at best a risky process that can generate a great deal of discomfort, and this discomfort will be especially intense when the innovation has not been the work of those who are affected by it. It is also the case that internally generated technologies are likely to be more compatible with established organizational structures and activities. Moreover, an internally generated technology will probably have a “champion” within the organization who seeks its utilization, and management may be more inclined to pay attention to the ideas of their organization’s own personnel.

An individual firm that chooses to resist or ignore new technologies because of their source may ultimately find that security and pride have been purchased at a very great price.

                        The exclusive possession of a particular technology can confer great advantages on those who have it. Individual firms or whole countries may therefore go to great lengths to block the diffusion of these technologies. During the sixteenth century the glassmakers of Venice sought to prevent others from learning the secrets that went into the production of Venetian glass, and they even sent assassins to poison Venetian expatriates who had set up glassworks abroad. England enacted a law in 1719 that forbade the emigration of skilled artisans, such as the aforementioned Samuel Slater, whose knowledge of British equipment and practices was a crucial element in the early development of the American textile industry. The export of machinery also was forbidden from the 1780s until the middle of the nineteenth century.

                        对特定技术的独家拥有可以为拥有它的人带来巨大的优势。因此，个别公司或整个国家可能会不遗余力地阻止这些技术的传播。在16世纪，威尼斯的玻璃制造商试图阻止其他人了解威尼斯玻璃生产的秘密，他们甚至派遣刺客毒害在国外开设玻璃厂的威尼斯侨民。英格兰于 1719 年颁布了一项法律，禁止熟练工匠移民，例如前面提到的塞缪尔·斯莱特（Samuel Slater），他对英国设备和实践的了解是美国纺织业早期发展的关键因素。从1780年代到19世纪中叶，机器出口也被禁止。

                        Today, technologically advanced nations attempt to prevent the export of advanced technologies through export licensing requirements. Licenses may be denied if national security could be compromised by the transfer of a particular technology. The transmission of knowledge alone can also be deemed a threat. In 2012 the potential danger of scientific information falling into the wrong hands led to requests by the U.S. federal government to request two groups of researchers to temporarily withhold the publication of some research results involving the genetic manipulation of the virus responsible for bird flu. Although the research was conducted in order to aid in the prevention of future epidemics, it was feared that the data it generated could become the basis of a future bioterrorist attack.

The transfer of plans, equipment, data, and products are extremely difficult to stop, even with rigorous attempts at policing. Also, as exemplified by the case of Samuel Slater, the movement of people has historically been the main vehicle for the transfer of technologies. This sort of movement is very hard to stop, especially in a free society.

                        Finally, it is often the case that the most important “secret” is that a technology exists. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was a great deal of anguish in the United States after the Soviet Union exploded its first nuclear bomb. The general belief was that the Soviets had obtained our “atomic secrets,” and two Americans were executed for their role in passing on these “secrets.” But the Soviets had long known the most important thing: that a massive explosion could be produced through the fissioning of atomic nuclei. Once this fact was known, it was only a matter of time before the Soviets learned how to do it themselves, with or without the clandestine transfer of American technology. Knowing that a problem can be solved is often the most important step in its solution.

                        An individual or a business firm naturally wants technological diffusion to take place on its own terms. If it has developed a novel technology, it wants the benefits of that technology to accrue only to itself, and not to others who might be able to copy an invention that has required a great deal of effort and expense. This is a legitimate desire, and it has been recognized as such by the establishment of the patent system. The possession of a patent confers exclusive use of an invention; it is a legal monopoly. Without the prospect of such a monopoly, it is believed, there would be a diminished motivation to invent, and in the long run society as a whole would suffer from a slower rate of technological advance.

                    <span class="chi">
                        个人或商业公司自然希望按自己的方式进行技术传播。 如果它开发了一项新技术，它希望该技术的好处只归于自己，而不是可能复制这一技术的其他人。这是正当的愿望，专利制度的建立也承认了这一点。拥有专利就获得了一项发明的独家使用权；这是一种合法的垄断。人们相信，如果没有这种垄断的预期，发明的动力就会减弱，而且从长远来看，整个社会的技术进步速度将放缓。

                        Although it is aimed at restricting the sale or use of a particular technology to a single individual or firm, there are some ways in which the patent system may stimulate technological diffusion. The filing of a successful patent application makes the invention public, for the basic design and specifications are open to inspection by anyone willing to pay a small fee. In fact, the word “patent” is derived from the Latin verb pateo, which means “to open.” One of the chief justifications for awarding a patent is that the inventor has not attempted to keep his or her invention secret, but rather has revealed its workings to the public. As the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1933, an inventor “may keep his invention secret and reap its fruits indefinitely. In consideration of its disclosure and the consequent benefit to the community, the patent is granted.”

                        尽管它旨在将特定技术的销售或使用限制为单一个人或公司，但专利制度可以通过某些方式刺激技术传播。提交成功的专利申请会使发明公开，因为任何愿意支付少量费用的人都可以检查基本设计和规格。事实上，“专利”一词源自拉丁语动词 pateo，意思是“打开”。授予专利的主要理由之一是发明人并未试图对他或她的发明保密，而是向公众透露了其运作方式。正如美国最高法院在 1933 年裁定的那样，发明家“可以对其发明保密并无限期地收获成果。考虑到它的公开以及由此给社区带来的利益，它将被授予专利。”

                        Although direct copying is of course forbidden, access to the public record may give a clearer sense of how a technological problem may be addressed and may stimulate alternative approaches to its solution. Then, too, patent holders often pass their inventions to other firms in return for a licensing fee. This arrangement may allow for the more rapid diffusion of a technology because the licensing agreement often facilitates the transfer of supplementary material necessary for the best use of the device or process. In some cases, a licensing arrangement may result in a better product, as happened when DuPont developed waterproof cellophane after being licensed to produce the original version.

                    <span class="chi">
                        虽然直接复制当然是被禁止的，但访问公共记录可能会让人们更清楚地了解如何解决技术问题，并可能激发替代方法来解决它。然后，专利持有人也经常将他们的发明转让给其他公司，以换取许可费。这种安排可能允许更快速地传播技术，因为许可协议通常有助于转移最佳使用设备或过程所需的补充材料。在某些情况下，许可安排可能会产生更好的产品，就像杜邦在获得生产原始版本许可后开发防水玻璃纸时所发生的那样。

                        At the same time, however, patent protection may inhibit technological advance. A well-entrenched firm may hold a patent in order to suppress an invention that could seriously shake up existing routines or even threaten the firm’s existence. It seems as though everybody has a brother-in-law who knows a man who invented a way to make his car run on water straight from the garden hose, but “of course the big oil companies bought up all the patents.” One shouldn’t put much credence in these stories, but it is true that dominant companies have at times used their control of patents to restrict innovation, as happened with the design of light bulbs when General Electric held the key patents.

                        The use of patents to directly suppress certain technologies poses less of a threat to innovation than the widespread use of patenting as a strategic and tactical weapon. Patents are supposed to motivate individuals and business firms to create innovative products and processes, but according to critics, their primary purpose is to allow patentees to harass competitors, collect undeserved royalties, bolster the value of financial portfolios, and block innovations that pose potential threats to a firm’s market position. Critics of the present patent system have also called attention to the monopoly power that has been conferred by a recent upsurge in the patenting of entities that in the past were not entitled to patent protection, most notably computer software, genes, and business methods.

                        Although it may confer considerable power in the marketplace, the holding of a patent does not necessarily confer an overwhelming competitive advantage, since there may be considerable scope for “inventing around” the patent. Moreover, there are no industries where a key technology is covered by a single “master patent” that can be used to repulse potential competitors. There have been attempts to dominate an emerging industry through the wielding of a patent, most notably when, in 1895, George B. Selden was granted a patent for the automobile. Selden and the subsequent holders of the patent were able to extract licensing fees from most automobile manufacturers. One manufacturer who refused to go along was Henry Ford, who successfully challenged the validity of the patent in court and won a great deal of public acclaim as a result.

                        尽管它可能会在市场上赋予相当大的权力，但拥有专利并不一定会带来压倒性的竞争优势，因为“围绕”专利进行“发明”的空间可能相当大。此外，没有任何行业的一项关键技术被单一的“核心专利”覆盖，可以用来击退潜在的竞争对手。人们曾试图通过使用专利来主导一个新兴产业，最著名的是 1895 年乔治·B·塞尔登(George B. Selden)被授予汽车专利。塞尔登和后来的专利持有人能够从大多数汽车制造商那里收取许可费。一位拒绝配合的制造商是亨利福特，他在法庭上成功挑战了专利的有效性，并因此赢得了广泛的公众赞誉。

                        It also has to be recognized that a patent never confers ironclad protection for inventors; it may be little more than a “license to sue.” In recent years, most patent holders have successfully waged court battles against individuals and firms who have been accused of infringing upon their patents, but both sides may incur sizeable costs in terms of time, talent, and money. As a result, many individuals and firms have been content to exploit their unpatented invention until the copiers are able to seize a large share of the market. In other cases, patented products and processes are quickly outmoded by the advance of technology, and a temporary monopoly position is soon lost. On the other side of the coin, parties who have been charged with patent infringement may feel that they are in the right, but they will nonetheless elect to pay royalties to the patentee in order to avoid an expensive and drawn-out courtroom battle.

                        Mention technological change to some workers, and a cold chill is likely to go down their backs. Lurking behind many an innovation is the threat of a job lost. This is not an irrational fear. Throughout history, and especially in the modern era, many production technologies have been explicitly motivated by the desire to increase productivity. Since productivity is usually measured in terms of output per worker, the consequences of productivity increases seem clear: the reduction or elimination of labor. For example, if worker productivity increases at a rate of 2 percent a year—less than the post-World War II average in the United States—the size of the economy will double in about 35 years. On the other hand, productivity growth can be cast in negative terms by noting that today’s output of goods and services would require only half the number of workers 35 years from now.

If a relatively few workers can perform all the necessary labor, large numbers of people will end up with no jobs and no work to do. At least that is the fear. Fortunately, the situation is more complicated. Technology’s effects on employment are substantial, but they also can be contradictory. In this chapter we will trace the complex connections between technological change and unemployment by looking at the historical record, and by considering where the productivity improvements wrought by technological change seem to be leading us. In addition, the chapter will briefly consider how technological change has affected the distribution of income, and will note some of the consequences of globalization, a process that has accompanied technological advance, which also influences employment and worker remuneration.

In 1920, the American railroads employed 113,000 locomotive engineers and 91,000 firemen. In 2002, these railroads carried a much greater volume of freight but needed only 40,000 engineers and no firemen to do so. During the early 1980s, studio musicians saw recording jobs erode by more than a third as a result of the growing use of musical synthesizers. From 1972 to 1977,21 percent more telephone calls were made throughout the Bell System, yet the number of operators fell by 32 percent. Over a five-year period beginning in 2002, steel production increased by almost 5 percent, yet employment fell 10 percent. During the same period, corn production went up by 30 percent while farm payrolls dropped by about the same percentage.

                        对技术变革的粗略研究揭示了许多因技术进步而失去工作的例子。1920 年，美国铁路雇佣了 113,000 名机车工程师和 91,000 名消防员。2002 年，此时铁路运输的货物量要大得多，但只需要40,000名工程师，且不需要消防员。在 1980 年代初期，由于音乐合成器的使用越来越多，录音室音乐家的录音工作减少了三分之一以上。从 1972 年到 1977 年，使用贝尔系统拨打的电话增加了21%，但接线员的数量却下降了32%。从 2002 年开始的五年期间，钢铁产量增加了近5%，但就业人数下降了10%。同期，玉米产量增加了30%，而农业就业人数下降了大约相同的百分比。

                        Striking as these developments have been, they are not unique to our times. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, the power loom forced many handloom weavers out of their traditional craft, and those who stayed on did so only because they were willing to accept miserably low wages. Many similar examples could be extracted from the history of the Industrial Revolution. The introduction of machinery threatened the livelihood of many workers and produced a considerable amount of social unrest. Attempts to introduce the spinning jenny into the English woolen trade during the late eighteenth century resulted in numerous riots. By the early nineteenth century, worker resistance to new machinery was widespread in several regions of England, culminating, as we saw in Chapter 2, in the machine-smashing Luddite outbreaks.

                        尽管这些发展引人注目，但它们并不是我们这个时代独有的。 从 18 世纪后期开始，动力织布机迫使许多手工织布工放弃了他们的传统工艺，而那些坚持下来的人只是因为他们能接受那低得可怜的工资。从工业革命的历史中可以找到许多类似的例子。机器的引进威胁到许多工人的生计，并引发了相当大的社会动荡。 在 18 世纪后期将纺纱珍妮引入英国羊毛贸易的尝试导致了多次骚乱。 到 19 世纪初期，工人对新机器的抵制在英格兰的几个地区普遍存在，正如我们在第2章中看到的那样，它们以粉碎机器的勒德派(Luddite)暴动而告终。

                        Opposition to new technologies because of their consequences for employment has not been confined to the workers whose jobs were threatened. The fear of the effects of new technology on employment has on occasion moved public officials to take drastic actions. In 1638 the British government banned the use of “engines for working of tape, lace, ribbon, and such, wherein one man doth more amongst them than seven English men can doe.” A more extreme (although perhaps apocryphal) example comes from the Polish city of Danzig, where in 1661 the municipal authorities destroyed a mechanical ribbon loom and drowned its inventor, for fear that the new device would put hand weavers out of work. Consignment to a watery oblivion also was advocated for a mechanical cotton picker by the Jackson, Mississippi, Daily News in the late 1930s: “It should be driven right out of the cotton fields and sunk into the Mississippi River, together with its plans and specifications. Nothing could be more devastating to labor conditions in the South than a cotton-picking machine.”

                        Examples, however numerous, do not conclusively prove that technological advance is incompatible with high levels of employment. Although there can be no dispute that particular technological changes have resulted in job losses and attendant personal tragedies, this does not tell the whole story. The effects of technological change are complex, and it is easy to fix upon one particular result and ignore others. Rather than dwell exclusively on the fate of particular industries and occupations, it is essential to consider the larger picture.

                        When considering the effects of technological change on the overall level of employment, one thing must always be kept in mind: even if all available technologies were used to their utmost, there would still be plenty of work to do. In many parts of the world today, including many “developed” countries, there are still large numbers of people who lack the basic necessities and amenities of life. More and better food needs to be produced and distributed, more houses built, more clothing manufactured. People need to be educated, healed, and entertained. Even with high levels of affluence, needs and wants do not decrease. When it comes to the consumption of goods and services, it is likely that high levels of consumption do not diminish the desire for still higher levels of consumption; appetite may grow with eating. Although it may not be a particularly noble trait, the desire to acquire more and more is present in most human beings. As a result, progressively higher levels of economic development may generate the need for continued high (or perhaps higher) levels of production. As economists have noted, scenarios of widespread unemployment induced by technological change are predicated on what has been called the “lump of labor fallacy,” which postulates that there is only so much work on hand for a given workforce. But as we have just seen, there is no intrinsic reason that work cannot expand as more people enter the workforce or lose the jobs that they had held. At the same time, however, it has to be recognized that the realization of potential job opportunities will depend on having a labor force with the requisite skills (or the ability to develop them) and a political and economic system able and willing to pay for the work that needs to be done.

                        在考虑技术变革对整体就业水平的影响时，必须始终牢记一点：即使最大限度地利用了所有可用的技术，工作仍然还是有很多的。在当今世界的许多地方，包括许多“发达国家”，仍有大量人缺乏基本的生活必需品和便利设施。需要生产和分配更多更好的食物，建造更多的房屋，制造更多的衣服。人们需要接受教育、治疗和娱乐。即使富裕程度很高，需求也不会减少。当谈到商品和服务的消费时，高消费水平很可能不会减少对更高消费水平的渴望；食欲可能会随着进食而增长。虽然这可能不是一个高尚的品质，但大多数人的确都渴望获得越来越多的东西。因此，逐渐提高的经济发展水平可能会产生对持续高（或更高）生产水平的需求。正如经济学家所指出的那样，由技术变革引起的广泛失业的情景是基于所谓的“劳动力谬误”，即假定特定劳动力只有手头这么多工作。但正如我们刚刚看到的，随着越来越多的人进入劳动力市场或失去他们原来的工作，没有内在的原因另他们不能扩展自身的工作。然而，与此同时，必须认识到，潜在工作机会的实现将取决于拥有具备必要技能（或开发技能的能力）的劳动力以及能够并愿意为完成的工作支付工资的政治和经济体系。

                        The seemingly endless expansion of needs and desires can be seen clearly in the field of medicine. As we have seen in Chapter 7, despite stupendous achievements in medical technology, we find that the monetary and human resources being devoted to health care have increased rather than diminished. Indeed, the rising cost of health care, which now takes more than 17 percent of our gross national income, has become a major social and political issue. New medical technologies have generated new possibilities and new hopes. Instead of accepting sickness and death as the inevitable working of fate or God’s will, we expect that cures will be found and that medical personnel will be available to administer them. It should therefore come as no surprise to find that employment projections indicate that the demand for health-care workers has increased year after year and in all likelihood will continue to do so in the future.

                        看似无穷无尽的需求和欲望的扩张，在医学领域可以看得很清楚。 正如我们在第 7 章中看到的，尽管医疗技术取得了巨大的成就，但我们发现用于医疗保健的资金和人力资源是增加而不是减少。 事实上，医疗保健成本上升，现在占我们国民总收入的 17% 以上，并且已经成为一个主要的社会和政治问题。新的医疗技术带来了新的可能性和新的希望。 我们不接受疾病和死亡是命运或上帝旨意的必然结果，而是希望能找到治疗方法，并有医疗人员来管理它们。 因此，就业预测表明对医疗保健工作者的需求逐年增加，并且很可能在未来继续增加，这一点也就不足为奇了。

                        As this example indicates, technological advances will not lead to job losses if the demand for products and services increases at the same pace as increases in productivity. It is also important to bear in mind that the level of demand is affected by the price of a particular product or service. If productivity increases bring down the cost, more people can afford it, thereby increasing the size of the market for that product. This, in turn, may motivate an employer to take on more workers so that the increased demand can be met. Much of the history of mass production conforms to this pattern, as exemplified by the automobile industry and the interrelated increases in productivity, employment, production, and purchases that began when Henry Ford began to produce large numbers of Model T cars during the second decade of the twentieth century.

                        正如这个例子所表明的那样，如果对产品和服务的需求与生产力的增长同步增长，技术进步就不会导致失业。同样重要的是，要记住，需求水平受特定产品或服务价格的影响。如果生产力的提高降低了成本，那么更多的人就可以负担得起，从而扩大该产品的市场规模。 反过来，这可能会激励雇主雇用更多工人，以满足增加的需求。规模化生产的历史大多符合这种模式，正如汽车工业以及在20世纪第二个十年中亨利·福特开始生产大量T型汽车时开始的生产力、就业、生产和采购的相关增长所证明的那样。

                        In other cases, lower prices may not result in significantly higher levels of demand, because people will buy only so much of a particular product irrespective of its price. (In the jargon of economists, such a product is “price inelastic”.) Even so, since consumers pay a lower price for this product, they have more money left over to spend on other things. This increases the effective demand for other products and enhances employment prospects in the industries that make them. To be sure, many economists believe that there may be times when aggregate demand will be insufficient because consumers prefer to save the extra money rather than spend it on new purchases. According to many economic historians, this phenomenon of “underconsumption” may in fact have been the underlying cause of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Under such circumstances, governments may have to stimulate demand by increasing their own expenditures, even if this means running budgetary deficits.

                        在另一些情况下，较低的价格可能不会导致需求水平显着提高，因为无论价格如何，人们只会购买一定数量的特定产品。用经济学家的行话来说，这样的产品是“价格无弹性的”。）即便如此，由于消费者为这种产品支付的价格较低，他们还有更多的钱可以花在其他事情上。 这增加了对其他产品的有效需求，并改善了制造这些产品的行业的就业前景。 可以肯定的是，许多经济学家认为，有时总需求可能会不足，因为消费者更愿意将多余的钱存起来，而不是花在新的购买上。 许多经济史学家认为，这种“消费不足”现象实际上可能是 1930 年代大萧条的根本原因。 在这种情况下，政府可能不得不通过增加自己的支出来刺激需求，即使这意味着预算赤字。

                        As a final point, it is also important to remember that technological change often generates problems that require that a great deal of work be done. Animal and plant habitats need to be restored, bodies of water require purification, and victims of accidents and pollution need medical care. Many nuclear power plants are nearing the end of their useful lives, and safely decommissioning them will entail years of labor by thousands of workers. In general, the cost of environmental cleanups is hardly trivial; as was noted in Chapter 6, the United States will have to spend billions if dollars each year for many years just to deal with hazardous wastes and old refuse dumps. The funds spent on environmental cleanup and protection can be the basis of many jobs.

While some technologies destroy existing human jobs, others produce jobs that had not existed earlier. No one worked as a locomotive engineer before the coming of the railroad, and there was no need for X-ray technicians before the twentieth century. In fact, most of the occupations held today did not even exist a hundred years ago. This trend can be expected to continue. Occupations such as genetic engineer, global positioning system technician, website designer, and social media strategist could hardly be imagined a generation ago, but they will become increasingly significant as the technologies that gave rise to them are developed and deployed.

Because of its small size and low power requirements, the transistor’s first practical application was to make hearing aids more compact and efficient.

Today’s economy is much more complex, so no one technology is likely to have the same impact. It is unlikely that any recent technological innovation will equal the greatest job generator of the twentieth century: the automobile. Although direct employment in the automotive industry has steadily declined in recent years, the approximately 250 million cars and light trucks on America’s roads provide employment for legions of mechanics, sales personnel, and insurance agents, as well as many workers whose jobs are indirectly tied to the automotive culture and are employed in everything from oil refineries to fast-food restaurants.

Television also has had a considerable, if unmeasurable, impact on economic growth by stimulating a demand for new products and services that are presented on programs and commercials. In similar fashion, the spread of computers into our economy has been essential to the development of new industries, videogames, and social media being the most obvious. All in all, some jobs have been lost as computers increased productivity in clerical, manufacturing, and other occupations, but at the same time new jobs are being created as computers have stimulated the growth of new or existing industries.

                        Since the effects of jet aircraft, television, computers, and other advanced technologies are often indirect, their role in job creation is often obscured. It is much easier to take note of those jobs that have been directly eliminated by an emergent technology, for they are dramatic and often well publicized. The indirect effects of technological change on job creation are less easily noted. To take another example, it has been noted that the spread of e-mail and other computer-based communication systems will result in diminished use of the postal system and the loss of jobs for hundreds of thousands of postal workers. This is true to some extent, but at the same time, the rise of e-commerce has increased the use of the U.S. Postal Service and other delivery services for the shipment of parcels. Another consequence of computerization has been a great expansion of junk mail. Not everyone enjoys receiving piles of advertisements and solicitations, but they certainly have kept letter carriers busy, while creating a fair number of new jobs for other people.

                        When people visualize technological change in the workplace, they often conjure up an image of legions of robots doing what people used to do. There is no denying that robots have been making an impact on factory production. In 2008, 1.3 million industrial robots were working in the world’s factories. Moreover, robots are only the final step in a more general process of automating production. Computer-aided design (CAD) systems make it possible to “draw” a design onscreen, change its size and shape, call up stored shapes, and rotate the design to see how it looks from different perspectives. The design can then be tested through the use of computerized procedures. When the design work is completed, the new product can be built by a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system, in which computerized instructions run the robots and other machinery that fabricate and assemble the parts that have been designed with the help of computers.. Computerized systems can also be used to organize the manufacturing process by scheduling production, directing the movement of parts, and generally keeping everything under control.

                        Industrial computers are also the basis of flexible manufacturing systems that alter the basic rules of mass production. Instead of using special-purpose machines that do only one thing, it is possible to use general-purpose machines that can be quickly reprogrammed to do a variety of things. For example, automobile manufacturers can now rapidly reprogram assembly-line robots to do different welding operations, depending on what is coming down the line, all of which happens in response to a bar code affixed to a rail running below the vehicle. Flexibility of this sort is especially important for the manufacture of products that are made in small quantities or undergo rapid changes in specifications.

Over time, it is hoped, they will become part of an integrated system that governs the total manufacturing process from initial design to the testing of the completed product. When this occurs, a great deal of production will take place with very little direct human intervention.

                        As exciting as these developments are, the advance of industrial automation will be a slow process. Automated manufacturing systems are very expensive, with each workstation costing up to a million dollars. More important, many technical problems remain unsolved. There are still many difficulties surrounding the transport of materials from one station to another without human intervention. Robots are particularly difficult to adapt to assembly operations, and a lot of hand labor, much of it done in low-wage countries, is still used for assembly operations. Robots and other elements of automated production technology have been eliminating some jobs, but there are limits to how far this process can go. There even have been some cases where robots have been replaced by human workers in industrial settings in which people learn faster, are more flexible, take up less space, and work cheaper and faster.

Even worse, a small programming error can cause thousands of dollars of damage to machines and material in a few seconds.

                        Although automated industrial processes have been only partially realized, there is no denying that they have made substantial inroads into manufacturing employment. Robots, computerized controls, and CAD-CAM systems have reduced the need for human labor in many industries, a process that will continue in the years to come. But alarming as this prospect may appear, it is nothing new. Over the last century, many of the jobs performed by manufacturing workers have been lost to mechanization, yet total employment has undergone a massive increase. This has occurred because the bulk of job creation, especially in recent decades, has been not in the production of goods but in the supply of services. In 1950, 18.1 million workers were employed in manufacturing, construction, and raw materials extraction, while 26 million worked in the service sector. By 2012, with 88.9 million additional job holders, these figures were 18.74 million and 114.3 million, respectively. In the 1950s, manufacturing, construction, and raw materials extraction were pillars of the economy; they are still important, but they have steadily declined as sources of employment. As simple arithmetic shows, the number of these jobs has not dropped in absolute terms, but they have fallen sharply relative to service occupations. In 2012, manufacturing, construction, and resource extraction had only 64,000 more jobs than in 1950; for the service sector the number was more than 88.3 million. Even these figures may underestimate the extent to which services have been numerically dominant in modern economies. Many jobs in the manufacturing sector are actually service occupations. Independent consulting engineers provide a service, and are put in this category for statistical purposes, but if they perform similar duties as members of the engineering staff of a manufacturing enterprise, they appear as manufacturing employees. The number of workers performing service-type functions in the manufacturing sector is large and growing, another indication of the changing nature of work.

                        尽管仅部分实现了自动化工业流程，但不可否认，它们已经在制造业就业方面取得了重大进展。机器人、计算机控制和 CAD-CAM 系统减少了许多行业对人力的需求，这一过程将在未来几年继续下去。但尽管这种前景可能令人担忧，但这并不是什么新鲜事。上个世纪，制造业工人从事的许多工作已经被机械化所取代，但总就业人数却出现了大幅增长。之所以出现这种情况，是因为创造的大部分就业机会，尤其是最近几十年，不是在商品生产中，而是在服务供应中。 1950 年，制造业、建筑业和原材料开采业雇佣了 1810 万名工人，而服务业雇佣了 2600 万名工人。到 2012 年，新增工作岗位 8890 万，这些数字分别为 1874 万和 1.143 亿。 1950 年代，制造业、建筑业和原材料开采业是经济支柱；它们仍然很重要，但它们作为就业来源已经稳步下降。简单的算术表明，这些工作的绝对数量并没有下降，但相对于服务业而言，它们的数量急剧下降。 2012 年，制造业、建筑业和资源开采业的就业岗位仅比 1950 年多 64,000 个；对于服务部门，这一数字超过 8830 万。就算是这样的数字也可能低估了服务业在现代经济中占主导地位的程度。制造业中的许多工作实际上是服务性职业。独立咨询工程师提供服务，出于统计目的被归入这一类，但如果他们与制造企业的工程人员履行类似职责，则他们会显示为制造员工。制造业中从事服务类职能的工人数量庞大且不断增长，这是工作性质不断变化的另一个迹象。

Shoeshine boys perform a service, just as neurosurgeons do. What many of these varied services have in common, however, is that they incorporate a personal element. This in fact is what makes them desired by consumers who have a surfeit of manufactured goods. For many people, the most sophisticated machine is no substitute for human contact. This desire will likely retard the replacement of human service providers by even the most sophisticated technologies. Computer-based expert systems can do an excellent job of diagnosing certain illnesses, but they fall short in providing a significant element in recovery from many illnesses—a patient’s confidence in the services provided by a skilled medical practitioner.

                        The desire for services shows no signs of abating, and this sector will generate many future jobs. Still, relying on services to drive the economy and provide jobs seems to violate common sense. The basis of human survival is food, clothing, shelter, and the implements necessary to sustain life. How can the majority of the work force be employed in occupations that directly contribute nothing to production? In fact, much economic progress can be interpreted as an ongoing reduction of the number of workers employed in producing the necessities of life. Two hundred years ago, more than half of the population of Europe earned their livelihood by growing food, just as is the case in many poor countries today. With the rise of industrialization and the provision of such things as irrigation pumps, mechanized farm implements, and chemical pesticides and fertilizers, the labor requirements of agriculture steadily dropped, until today less than 5 percent of the work force in most industrial countries is engaged in farming. The same thing could happen in manufacturing in the years to come.

In the case of the service sector, however, modern technologies are often conspicuous by their absence. This is a major reason for the slow growth in productivity that has been characteristic of the American economy in recent years. While manufacturing employees have made much use of machines that embody increasingly sophisticated technologies, many service occupations have been only lightly touched by them. As a result, the desire for more services can be met only by employing more workers.

                        Perhaps the clearest example of the labor-absorbing quality of services can be found in education. Despite efforts to use computers, audio-visual aids, and machine-scored exams, teaching is conducted much as it was in the time of Socrates: through lectures and discussions, both of which require some degree of personal contact. Since much of the appeal of a service has to do with the human contact it provides, the more “productive” a service job is, the less satisfying it may be for the consumer. A teacher could greatly increase his or her productivity by lecturing to a class of 500 rather than 25, but most students would find so “productive” a class much less enjoyable, and the lack of personal attention would probably result in lowered levels of learning for many of them. It is also significant that one of the most successful online educational programs, the Khan Academy, is most effective when students have the opportunity to interact on a face-to-face basis with human teachers who go over students’ homework, monitor their pro-gress, and help them with any difficulties they may have encountered. To be sure, a good many services have experienced sizable productivity gains through the introduction of labor-saving technologies. The classic example of this can be found in the telephone industry. If telephone calls were still manually switched as they were in the 1920s, today’s level of telephone traffic would require no fewer than 50 million operators. Although the impact may not be as profound, it is likely that many of today’s services will also experience technologically induced productivity gains and corresponding drops in employment. E-mail, word processing, automated banking, and the like have undoubtedly caused job losses, and will continue to do so. But does this mean that unemployment will necessarily increase? Here, again, the example of the telephone industry may be relevant. Some actual, and millions of potential, jobs were lost due to the introduction of automatic telephone switching, but total employment in the telephone industry continued to rise because increased levels of demand stimulated the industry’s expansion. Equally important, the expansion of telephone communications has acted as a powerful stimulant to the economy as a whole, leading to the creation of many jobs that would not otherwise exist. The job-creating qualities of a new technology are usually hard to predict in advance, but they are there all the same.

                        At this point it can be fairly argued that the creation of new jobs through technological change is not the whole story; also in question is the nature of the jobs created, and in particular, how well they pay. In this regard, the record of recent years has been mixed. On the one hand, technological change has resulted in the emergence of many new, high-paying occupations and business opportunities. On the other hand, technological change has been implicated in diminished economic opportunities and an overall reduction in wages for significant portions of the labor force.

                        在这一点上，可以公平地说，通过技术变革创造新的就业机会并不是全部； 还有一个问题是所创造的工作的性质，特别是它们的报酬如何。 在这方面，近年来的记录喜忧参半。 一方面，技术变革催生了许多新的高薪职业和商机。 另一方面，技术变革与经济机会减少和大部分劳动力的工资总体下降有关。

                        One group that has seen a reduction in wages relative to the rest of the labor force is composed of workers with only a high school education or less. Technological change is surely a culprit here, as mechanization has eliminated many jobs that a generation ago paid decent wages while requiring few skills. For the economy as a whole, the loss of these jobs has not resulted in widespread unemployment, because the loss has been offset by large employment increases in the service sector. But this is not all there is to it, because compensation (wages and benefits) in service-sector jobs on average is not as remunerative as in manufacturing jobs, although there is wide variation within the former.

                        By contributing to the drift from manufacturing to service-sector employment, technological change has been linked to one of the most troubling economic and social trends in the United States today, the growing wealth and income gap that separates the top stratum of the population from everybody else. This situation has intensified in recent decades; in 1975 the top 20 percent of American households accounted for 40.7 percent of the income received in the United States. By 2009 their share had climbed to 50.3 percent. The shift from manufacturing to services has not been the only reason for the widening income gap; many other social and economic changes have contributed: changes in family structure, economic globalization, reductions in government benefits for the poor, increased immigration, stagnant minimum wages, and the erosion of union power, to name a few.

                        Although it is likely that technological change has exacerbated wage inequality, a precise reckoning is still a matter of debate. Assessing technology’s contribution to the skewing of the distribution of income is difficult because much of it operates indirectly. In some cases the consequences of technological change are straightforward; a single computer programmer designs an automated system that results in job losses for a dozen reasonably well-paid assembly-line workers. But many other effects of technological change are more subtle. The installation and use of technologically sophisticated operations is not simply a matter of replacing manual workers with robots and other computer-controlled devices and processes. Realizing the potential of digital technologies often requires a fundamental restructuring of a firm’s organizational structure and operations. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee summarize, “The most productive firms reinvented and reorganized decision rights, incentive systems, information flows, hiring systems, and other aspects of organizational capital in order to get the most from the technology.” As a result, the high earners are not just the technically proficient members of the labor force but also include well-educated men and women with a broad range of aptitudes and skills.

                        尽管技术变革很可能加剧了工资不平等，但精确计算它们仍是一个有争议的问题。评估技术对收入分配偏差的贡献是困难的，因为其中大部分是间接运作的。在某些情况下，技术变革的后果是直截了当的；一个计算机程序员设计了一个自动化系统，导致十几名收入合理的装配线工人失业。但技术变革的许多其他影响更为微妙。技术复杂操作的安装和使用不仅仅是用机器人和其他计算机控制的设备和流程取代体力劳动者的问题。实现数字技术的潜力通常需要对公司的组织结构和运营进行根本性的重组。正如 Erik Brynjolfsson 和 Andrew McAfee 总结的那样，“生产力最高的公司重塑并重组了决策权、激励系统、信息流、招聘系统和组织资本的其他方面，以便从技术中获得最大收益。”因此，高收入者不仅是劳动力中技术熟练的成员，而且还包括受过良好教育、具有广泛才能和技能的男女。

                        The effects of technological change on jobs and remuneration are particularly evident when we focus on specific segments of the labor force. To take one obvious example, technological change can make life very difficult for older workers, especially those with limited skills. The fact that technological change may have increased economic opportunities overall is no comfort to a veteran auto worker who was displaced from a well-paying job by a robot welder. Although qualified workers will be needed to program and repair the robot, such jobs are not likely to go to the former auto worker. They may go to his son or daughter, but for a mature worker with obsolete skills, the future is bleak unless training programs and some form of income supplement can help him through a difficult period of transition.

The situation is not altogether dire; although older workers are sometimes stereotyped as being difficult to re-train, several studies have shown that this is not the case. The biggest impediment to equipping older workers with new skills may not inhere in the workers themselves, but rather stems from the erroneous belief that old dogs can’t learn new tricks.

                        The loss of jobs as a result of technological change is an old story. A more recent source of job losses has been economic globalization—in particular, the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to low-wage countries. Much of this has been the work of multinational corporations (MNCs). The availability of low-wage labor in the poor countries of the world is often cited as the primary reason for moving jobs abroad, but it is not the only one; MNCs may have operations in other countries because they want to be close to important markets, insulate themselves from currency fluctuations, reduce transportation costs, and avoid tariffs and other trade barriers. Access to cheap labor is undoubtedly an important motivation for transplanting jobs to a poor country, but the advantages of a low-paid workforce may be offset by other costs. A successful offshore operation requires adequate communication and transportation infrastructures, trainable workers, and at least minimally effective and honest governments. If cheap labor were all that mattered, all of the world’s manufacturing would be done in sub-Saharan Africa.

                        技术变革导致的工作岗位流失已是老生常谈。最近失业的一个来源是经济全球化——特别是制造业工作岗位外包到低工资国家。其中大部分是跨国公司 (MNC) 的工作。世界上贫穷国家的低工资劳动力经常被认为是将工作转移到国外的主要原因，但这并不是唯一的原因。跨国公司可能在其他国家开展业务，因为它们希望靠近重要市场、避免货币波动、降低运输成本并避免关税和其他贸易壁垒。获得廉价劳动力无疑是将工作转移到贫穷国家的重要动力，但低薪劳动力的优势可能会被其他成本抵消。成功的海上作业需要足够的通信和运输基础设施、可培训的工人以及至少最低限度的有效和诚实的政府。如果廉价劳动力才是最重要的，那么世界上所有的制造业都将在撒哈拉以南非洲完成。

                        Although technological change and the offshoring of jobs are separate phenomena, they are closely related. Technological change in the form of shipping containers and intermodal transport systems has dramatically lowered the cost of transporting manufactured items from low-wage countries to consumers abroad. A typical case of intermodal transportation begins with a manufacturing plant loading its products into shipping containers, which then travel by truck to a port where the containers are loaded onto a ship that may take the products halfway around the world. The containers are then put on railroad flat cars bound for a distribution point, where they are offloaded onto trucks that take them to their final destination. Through this process, the costs of loading, unloading, and reloading crates and boxes are eliminated, and losses due to the effects of weather, damage, and pilferage are greatly reduced.

                        虽然技术变革和工作外包是不同的现象，但它们密切相关。 集装箱和多式联运系统形式的技术变革大大降低了将制成品从低工资国家运输到国外消费者的成本。 一个典型的多式联运案例始于制造工厂将其产品装入集装箱，然后由卡车运往港口，在那里集装箱被装载到一艘可能将产品运往半个地球的船上。 然后将集装箱放在开往配送点的铁路平车上，在那里它们被卸载到卡车上，然后将它们带到最终目的地。 通过这个过程，装卸和重装板条箱和箱子的成本被消除，由于天气、损坏和盗窃的影响而造成的损失大大减少。

                        While improved technologies have lowered the time and expense of the transportation of physical goods, the rapid advance of digital technologies has made it possible to transfer information at close to the speed of light—company memos, contracts, technical diagrams, legal briefs, market reports, and anything else that can be digitized. This has made it possible to offshore some activities requiring expert knowledge, such as interpreting lab tests, as well as some requiring minimal skills, such as processing bill payments and staffing call centers. As of now, however, job losses due to moving white-collar work to low-wage countries have been less evident than the loss of manufacturing jobs to these countries. Many information-related occupations will likely remain in the industrially developed world because they require a fair amount of face-to-face interaction and relationships based on trust. And even when some elements of the job can be reduced to digitized communications, as has been noted above, it will still be necessary to employ creative, well-educated workers to initiate, guide, oversee, and evaluate the kinds of changes that are essential to the realization of the potential advantages of digital technologies.

                        In sum, economic globalization has brought benefits by lowering the price of goods, facilitating the diffusion of modern technologies, and in general opening up the world to new ideas and ways of doing things. But it has had its unfortunate consequences as well. Throughout the developed world, empty steel mills, abandoned factories, and depopulated communities bear witness to industries and jobs lost to foreign competition. As with technological change, with which it is closely connected, economic globalization has created winners and losers. Manufacturing workers have been particularly hard hit as their jobs have been outsourced to countries with cheaper labor or other inducements. As we have seen, there is no inherent reason that technological advance should lead to long-term unemployment, and the same can be said of economic globalization. Both create new opportunities, but adjustments will not come automatically. As will be noted in the next section, matching job skills to these opportunities will require the implementation of appropriate policies in the private and public sectors.

                        In fact, there have been few effective programs to mitigate the inevitable destruction of some jobs by technological advance. When the necessary adjustments have been made, they have been done on an ad hoc basis. A few unionized workers have been able to nullify the job-destroying effects of technological advance by striking advantageous bargains with their employers. For example, locomotive firemen were left with little to do when the diesel-electric replaced the steam locomotive, but they were able to negotiate contracts that preserved their jobs for many years. Make-work schemes, however, do not address the real problem of technologically induced job loss. Most people seem to have a real need to work, and to do work that has some intrinsic meaning. At the same time, as has been noted, technological change has not eliminated the need for work. The problem, then, lies in putting the two together by preparing workers whose jobs have been eliminated by technological change to take on jobs for which a real need exists. In an era of rapid technological change there is a fundamental need for retraining programs that help displaced workers learn new skills and prepare them for new jobs.

                        Unfortunately, current training programs in the United States have not been up to the task. Although federal, state, and local governments have a number of job training programs in place, they are still restricted in scope and scale. In part this is due to the chronic underfunding of such programs, resulting in their inability to meet demand for them. But even with adequate funding, formal training programs can do only so much. The most effective training programs focus on skills used in a worker’s current job. In general, however, the private sector has failed to take a leading role in improving workers’ skills because employers fear that their workers will use their newly acquired skills to obtain better-paying positions elsewhere. The reluctance of employers to pay for retraining also results from tax policies. Some states offer a tax credit in return for incurring some training costs, and the federal government awards tax credits for the training of targeted employees such as veterans, but tax credits and deductions are more generous for investments in physical capital than they are for human capital. At the same time, many workers fail to take advantage of the retraining programs that do exist because these programs do not take into account workers’ skills and competencies. Many of the jobs eliminated by technological advance have been held by unskilled workers with limited education. A basic remedial program may thus be an essential component of a successful retraining program. And, sad to say, many young people are entering the labor force with serious deficiencies in essential reading and mathematics skills. Workers operating at these low levels are especially likely to be victimized by technological change, and it will be a major challenge to help them develop the skills that allow them to adjust to a technologically dynamic economy.

                        All in all, the fear that technological advance will lead to widespread unemployment seems unwarranted. Technological change does eliminate specific jobs, but it does not eliminate work itself. While some occupations are rendered redundant by new products and processes, others are being created. To be sure, this is cold comfort to mature workers who have been replaced by new machines. They may find work in America’s expanding service sector or even in businesses that have been created by recent technological advances, but in all likelihood they will suffer a cut in pay. Even those who land good jobs may do so at the cost of considerable dislocation. Technological change often results in the rise of some geographical regions and the decline of others. Eighty years ago the rise of the automobile industry stimulated the rapid expansion of the Detroit area. In recent years the development of the semiconductor industry has produced substantial growth in northern California’s Silicon Valley. Taking advantage of new job opportunities may require pulling up stakes and moving to an unfamiliar part of the country, leaving friends, family, and community behind.

                        总而言之，担心技术进步会导致普遍失业似乎是没有根据的。技术变革确实会消除特定的工作，但不会消除工作本身。虽然一些职业因新产品和新工艺而变得多余，但其他职业正在被创造出来。可以肯定的是，这对于被新机器取代的成熟工人来说是一种冷酷的安慰。他们可能会在美国不断扩大的服务业或什至是由最近的技术进步创造的企业中找到工作，但他们很可能会遭受减薪。即使是那些找到好工作的人，也可能以相当大的混乱为代价。技术变革往往导致某些地理区域的兴起和其他地理区域的衰落。八十年前，汽车工业的兴起刺激了底特律地区的快速扩张。近年来，半导体产业的发展在加州北部的硅谷产生了大幅增长。利用新的工作机会可能需要提高股份并搬到这个国家不熟悉的地方，把朋友、家人和社区抛在后面。

                        There is no getting around the fact that technological change can be a painful, disruptive process. Occupations rise and fall, and with them the fortunes of many individual people. There are spectacular winners and pathetic losers. Special efforts must be made if the latter are not to be ruined by the advance of technology. Technological change may destroy a career in which one has invested his or her whole life. It would be irresponsible and cruel to turn a blind eye to the needs of workers displaced by technological advance.

                        At the same time, it would be foolish to attempt to limit the development and spread of new technologies for fear of massive job losses. Far from being the product of technological advance, unemployment is much more likely to occur during periods of technological stagnation. One British labor historian has estimated that during the late seventeenth century, half the population of England were paupers because there was not enough work for them to do. This situation began to change only when a series of technological changes helped to produce the Industrial Revolution. After two centuries of technological advance significant numbers of people are still dogged by poverty and unemployment, but there is no denying that things are much better than they once were. Certainly our situation stands in stark contrast to the more technologically backward parts of the world, where vast unemployment and the poverty that accompanies it are the order of the day.

Although technological advance has expanded employment opportunities for millions of people, it still can be argued that it has led to the degradation of the work they do. People may have jobs, but they are dreary, alienating, and unrewarding. In the next chapter we will try to determine if this is really the case.

                        The word “manufacture” literally means the production of something by hand, and for most of human history, it was just that. Goods were produced in small numbers by individual craftsmen who relied on little more than their own skills and a few tools. This situation began to change markedly in the middle of the eighteenth century as industrialization began to transform the way that things were made. To be sure, this was a revolution that was a long time in the making; people did not pick up their newspapers one day in 1750 and read “Industrial Revolution Breaks Out in England!” Many of the changes that produced an industrial society were small and slow to develop. Others were more dramatic, but even these required numerous incremental changes before they were effective. But taken together, these changes utterly transformed the way things were made, and with them the way people worked. This process continues today, with technological advance constantly changing the nature of work. In this chapter we will consider the historical relationships between work and industrialization, as well as where they seem to be headed today.

                        “制造”这个词的字面意思是手工生产的东西，在人类历史的大部分时间里，制造也的确如此。商品由个别工匠小批量生产，他们只依靠自己的技能和一些工具。随着工业化开始改变事物的制造方式，这种情况在 18 世纪中叶开始发生显着变化。可以肯定的是，这是一场漫长的革命；1750 年的一天，没有报纸报纸刊登“英国爆发工业革命！” 许多产生工业社会的变化都很小，而且发展缓慢。其他的则更具戏剧性，但即使是这些也需要进行大量渐进式改变才最终为人注意。但总的来说，这些变化彻底改变了事物的制造方式，也随之改变了人们的工作方式。 这个过程今天仍在继续，技术进步不断改变工作的性质。 在本章中，我们将研究工作与工业化之间的历史关系，以及它们今天的发展方向。

                        An economy based on industrial production has a number of special characteristics. In the first place, it requires large amounts of energy. Before industrialization, almost all of the energy used came from organic sources: human and animal muscle power and the burning of wood and other plant products. Civilization rested on the physical labor of peasant farmers and artisans (and in many places, slaves), whose efforts produced the surplus that supported the activities of small numbers of artists, priests, and government officials. The use of new sources of energy allowed vast increases in production while at the same time lightening some of the physical burdens of work.

                        以工业生产为基础的经济有许多特点。 首先，它需要大量的能量。 在工业化之前，几乎所有使用的能源都来自有机来源：人和动物的肌肉力量以及木材和其他植物产品的燃烧。 文明依赖于农民和工匠（在许多地方还有奴隶）的体力劳动，他们的努力产生了剩余，用于支持少数艺术家、牧师和政府官员的活动。 新能源的使用极大地提高了产量，同时减轻了工作的一些体力负担。

                        The first new energy source for the emerging industrial economy was water power. Water wheels date back to antiquity, and were widely employed during the Middle Ages; over 5,000 of them could be found in England according to the eleventh-century Domesday Book. But these were simple devices that produced little power. With the mechanization of key industries such as spinning, weaving, and flour milling, larger, more elaborate wheels began to be used in great numbers. To an increasing degree they were built according to systematic, empirically derived principles, making them significantly more efficient.

                        Water wheels continued to be important industrial power sources well into the nineteenth century, at which time they slowly began to be supplanted by steam engines. Originally built to pump water out of mines, during the late eighteenth century the steam engine was brought to a higher level of efficiency by James Watt’s invention of the separate condenser. Of equal importance, Watt devised new linkages and gearing systems so that the up-and-down motion of a piston could be translated into rotary motion, which was essential for the powering of many types of industrial machinery.

                        During the Industrial Revolution steam engines and water wheels animated a great number of new machines. Among the most important of these were machine tools that could produce large numbers of identical parts. The possibilities of this system were first indicated in the early nineteenth century when the Franco-British engineer Marc Brunel teamed up with Henry Maudsley, a pioneer designer and builder of machine tools, to produce large numbers of pulley blocks for the British Navy. After they installed 44 machines at the Portsmouth (England) Navy Yard, their staff of 10 workers was able to produce 160,000 blocks a year, a larger output than the one that had been achieved by 110 men using traditional techniques.

                        The installation of power-driven machinery was complemented by the establishment of a new setting for productive work: the factory. Instead of the craftsman’s shop with its half-dozen or so workers, the dominant manufacturing enterprise was the large factory in which hundreds and even thousands of people performed the tasks that large-scale production required. As industrialization took hold, the size of manufacturing establishments grew rapidly. In 1870 one of the largest industrial enterprises in the United States, the McCormick reaper plant in Chicago, employed no more than 500 workers. Thirty years later, more than a thousand factories had between 500 and 1,000 workers, and over 400 had more than 1,000. Three steel plants and a locomotive works each had more than8,000 workers.

They now worked for a business firm, and were dependent on it for the tools they used, the facilities they worked in, and of course the money they took home. Independent workers ceased to be the foundation of the economy. The typical worker was now a hired member of a firm, a wage-earner rather than an independent producer. Industrialization had created a society of employees.

Not only were far more people working in a single enterprise, they were also socially and psychologically separate from their employers and detached from their other social roles and responsibilities. As a result, the face-to-face contact and personal attachments found in the craftsmen’s shop gave way to bureaucratized managerial methods. Hierarchical command structures, written rules, strict job definitions, the precise scheduling of work, and rigid procedures became typical ways of organizing production.

                        The spread of industrial technologies helped to make work a more regular and precisely scheduled process. New power technologies were of particular importance in making work follow strict temporal rhythms. Industrial processes that made use of steam engines and water wheels were obviously unsuited to irregularly paced methods of working. Since they were expensive pieces of capital equipment, these power sources and the machines they ran had to be operated constantly if they were to be used efficiently; sitting idle they produced no income. This meant that not only were the times of work more precisely scheduled, but work had to be performed at all hours. Shift work and labor at unsociable hours made their appearance, a situation that stood in marked contrast to the life of the craftsman working under guild regulations that usually prohibited working at night or under any form of artificial illumination.

                        Many of the new industries that emerged in the nineteenth century gave further impetus to precisely scheduled, clock-regulated work patterns. This was especially evident in the operation of one of the era’s key industries, the railroad. The size of this new enterprise, the multiplicity of tasks required, and above all the need for adhering to precise schedules made the railroad a key example of the temporal regularization of work. The emphasis on scheduling and the efficient use of time also had an effect on the larger economy and society. As Henry David Thoreau said of the railroads of his era:

                    <span class="chi">
                        19 世纪出现的许多新产业进一步推动了精确调度、时钟调节的工作模式。 这在那个时代的关键行业之一——铁路的运营中尤为明显。 这家新企业的规模、所需任务的多样性，以及最重要的是需要遵守精确的时间表，使铁路成为工作时间规律化的一个关键例子。 对时间安排和有效利用时间的重视也对更大的经济和社会产生了影响。 正如亨利·大卫·梭罗 (Henry David Thoreau) 在谈到他那个时代的铁路时所说：

                        They come and go with such regularity and precision, and their whistles can be heard so far, that farmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well-regulated institution regulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than they did in the state office?

                        During the railroad’s earliest years, railwaymen were required to carry “good watches and correct them daily.” From that time onward, the conductor’s pocket-watch, accurate to a few seconds a day, became emblematic of his occupation. On a larger scale, the demands of railroads led to the establishment in 1883 of Standard Time and the division of the United States into four time zones. No longer would each community observe a unique time that was based on a noontime determined by the highest point of the sun’s passage. A new technological system had produced the artificial method of marking time that we take so much for granted today.

                        The railroad was not the only industry that required high standards of temporal regularity in the workplace. In factories of every sort, workers had to accommodate themselves to the demands of the machinery, and in many cases the machines were harsh taskmasters. And not only was the pace more frenetic and unvarying, the work itself was often highly unsatisfying. For many of the new industrial occupations, the required work often called for only the most rudimentary skills. Many machines were designed so that the skill required inhered in the machine and not in the worker who tended it. Although the traditional labors of artisans and farmers also had their periods of drudgery and monotony, the factories that sprang up in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries seemed to usher in a new era of deadening labor—repetitious, narrowly specialized, radically simplified, and paced by the machine.

Machinery and the accompanying factory system increased production, but only at the cost of a cold, regimented on-the-job existence. Many would consider it a poor bargain. But the story is not yet complete; before we blame the advance of technology for the degradation of work, we must consider how these technologies came into being and whose interests they served.

Were industrial technologies in themselves the cause of the long working hours, monotonous routines, and the general degradation of labor often found in industrial economies?

                        The history of industrial technologies seems to indicate that similar technologies can support a variety of working arrangements. The use of steam power did not always require massive factories under centralized direction. In the Coventry ribbon industry, weaving was done on power looms situated in blocks of independent workshops that were arranged so that they could make use of a single steam engine. By the mid-nineteenth century, these cottage factories contained over 1,000 power looms, as many as could be found in the conventional factories throughout the city.

                        工业技术的历史似乎表明，类似的技术可以支持多种工作安排。 蒸汽动力的使用并不总是需要集中指导下的大型工厂。 在考文垂织带行业，编织是在位于独立车间块的动力织机上完成的，这些车间被安排成可以使用单个蒸汽机。 到 19 世纪中叶，这些家庭式工厂拥有 1,000 多台动力织机，与整个城市的传统工厂一样多。

                        The Coventry ribbon-weaving industry is not an isolated example. In Sheffield and Birmingham, cities at the very heart of England’s Industrial Revolution, local artisans could rent workspaces supplied with transmission belts connected to a centralized steam engine; “Power to Let” was a sign commonly seen in Birmingham during this period. Fundamental mechanical innovations of the early nineteenth century, such as the Jacquard loom (which introduced the use of punch cards for the guidance of an industrial operation), were used not in large factories but in small workshops that were often part of the workman’s home.

                        By themselves, these examples do not prove much. As we have seen, a fundamental feature of technological advance is that innovations begin to be used on a small scale and are steadily expanded as experience is gained with them. Still, the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century deployment of machines in factories of ever-increasing size was not simply the result of increasing technological sophistication; putting workers into large factories may also have been motivated by a need to control and discipline them.

                        Employers had long contended with strong-willed, independent workers under a variety of working arrangements. Before the Industrial Revolution one such arrangement was the domestic (or “putting out”) system of manufacture. An employer supplied workers with tools and raw materials that were to be used in the workers’ own homes. The employer then picked up the finished product several weeks later. This system gave the workers a good deal of autonomy and flexibility—too much, as far as many employers were concerned. The lack of direct supervision often resulted in shoddy products and a slow pace of production. Even worse, some workers bilked their employers by selling the raw materials, using an inferior substitute, and pocketing the difference.

                        雇主长期以来一直在各种工作安排下与意志坚强、独立的工人作斗争。 在工业革命之前，一种这样的安排是家庭（或“外包”）制造系统。 雇主提供给工人的工具和原材料用于工人自己的家中。 几周后，雇主取走了成品。 这个系统给了工人很大的自主权和灵活性——对许多雇主来说太多了。 缺乏直接监督往往导致产品以次充好和生产速度缓慢。 更糟糕的是，一些工人通过出售原材料、使用劣质替代品并将差价收入囊中来向雇主索取。

                        Given these managerial problems, it is easy to see the appeal that the factory had for many employers. Within the walls of the factory, the workers were required to put in regular hours while the pace of their work was controlled by foremen who closely supervised their activities. Although perhaps overstated, one scholar’s summation captures an essential reason for the development of the factory:

                        鉴于这些管理问题，很容易看出工厂对许多雇主的吸引力。 在工厂的围墙内，工人们被要求按时上班，而工头控制他们的工作节奏，密切监督他们的活动。 尽管可能被夸大了，但一位学者的总结抓住了工厂发展的一个重要原因：

                        It was purely for purposes of discipline, so that workers could be effectively controlled under the supervision of foremen. Under one roof, or within a narrow compass, they could be started to work at sunrise and kept going until sunset, barring periods for rest and refreshment. They could be kept working six days a week. And under the penalty of loss of all employment they could be kept going almost throughout the year.

                        The development of the factory made close managerial control possible. Even so, the closest management by itself cannot ensure regular work efforts. Unless one supervisor can be assigned to each worker, the latter will always find ways to escape scrutiny and evade work if so inclined. In extreme cases, disgruntled workers can even resort to sabotage, a word that derives from the throwing of wooden shoes—sabots—into the machinery. In a setting where workers are employees and have no direct stake in the success of their enterprise, such inclinations are likely to be widespread. In working environments like these, machinery takes on an importance that goes beyond the improvement of productive processes. Machine-based technologies can ensure that work is steadily performed and that it is performed in accordance with the requirements of the management. As one critic of management-inspired industrial technologies put it:

                        工厂化的密切管理控制成为可能。 即便如此，最亲近的管理层本身也无法确保正常的工作。 除非可以为每个工人分配一名主管，否则如果愿意，后者总会想方设法逃避审查和逃避工作。 在极端情况下，心怀不满的工人甚至可以诉诸破坏，这个词源于将木鞋（即木鞋）扔进机器。 在工人是雇员并且与企业的成功没有直接利害关系的环境中，这种倾向很可能很普遍。 在这样的工作环境中，机械的重要性超出了生产流程的改进。 基于机器的技术可以确保工作稳定进行，并按照管理层的要求进行。 正如一位受管理启发的工业技术的批评者所说：

                        Machinery offers to management the opportunity to do by wholly mechanical means that which it had previously attempted to do by organizational and disciplinary means. The fact that many machines may be paced and controlled according to centralized decisions, and that these controls may thus be in the hands of management, removed from the site of production to the office—these technical possibilities are of just as great interest to management as the fact that the machine multiplies the productivity of labor.

                        Machines can be complex and hard to manage, but people are even more difficult. Many employers eagerly sought machine technologies as a way of counteracting the vagaries of human motivation and performance. Machines provided a model of reliable performance, as well as a way of coaxing it out of their workers. The factory system that began to emerge in the late eighteenth century was not exclusively the consequence of the technologies employed; at least as important as the operational requirements of machine-based technologies were the desires and intentions of management.

                        A major characteristic of an industrial society is an extensive division of labor. Instead of a single craftsman performing all of the tasks involved in making a product, production is broken into small segments, each one performed by a different worker. This reduces production costs, as it is not necessary to pay top wages to a highly skilled worker to do everything; some of the work can be done by a person with lesser skills at lower wages.

                        工业社会的一个主要特征是广泛的分工。 不是由一个工匠来完成制造产品所涉及的所有任务，而是将生产分成小部分，每个部分由不同的工人执行。 这降低了生产成本，因为无需向高技能工人支付高薪即可完成所有工作； 有些工作可以由技能较低、工资较低的人来完成。

                        Production based on division of labor requires managerial control, but equally important, it makes such control easier to exert. As long as tasks are kept simple so that workers can be readily hired and fired, there will be little need to depend on workers with all-around skills. This can benefit management because the special abilities of skilled workers generate an independent spirit and a fair amount of economic leverage, as John Delorean’s description of the behavior of skilled toolmakers in the automobile industry illustrates:

That was it. Each guy figured, “What the hell. I don’t have to take this from anybody. I’m a pro. I know this business and I am not depending on you or anyone else.”

                        The ultimate marriage of machine technology and the division of labor is the assembly line. Instead of using a variety of skills and working at their own pace, workers perform specialized and repetitious tasks that are dictated by the tempo of the moving line. The development of this system of production is attributed to Henry Ford, and rightfully so. After taking his inspiration from the meat-packing industry (which introduced the use of punch cards for the guidance of an industrial operation), Ford and his associates realized productive gains that had scarcely been imagined in the past. Before Ford’s introduction of the moving line in 1913, automobiles were produced in small batches by workers with a multiplicity of skills. The work was undoubtedly more satisfying, but the product was high in price and necessarily limited to the rich. The assembly line allowed dramatic price cuts for two reasons: it drastically reduced the time needed for manufacture, and it allowed the substitution of low-wage, unskilled labor for the high-priced labor of all-around craftsmen. Ford’s description of work in his factory captures the essence of this new form of manufacture:
                    </span>
                    <span class="chi">
                        机器技术与分工的终极结合是流水线。工人不是使用各种技能并按照自己的节奏工作，而是执行由移动线的节奏决定的专门和重复的任务。这种生产系统的发展归功于亨利福特，这是理所当然的。福特和他的同事从肉类包装行业（该行业引入了使用穿孔卡片来指导工业操作）中汲取了灵感，实现了过去几乎无法想象的生产收益。在福特于 1913 年引入移动生产线之前，汽车是由具有多种技能的工人小批量生产的。产品无疑更令人满意，但产品价格高昂，必然仅限于富人。装配线允许大幅降价有两个原因：它大大减少了制造所需的时间，并且允许低工资、非熟练劳动力替代全能工匠的高价劳动力。福特对其工厂工作的描述抓住了这种新制造形式的精髓：

The assembling of the motor, formerly done by one man, is now divided into eighty-four operations—those men do the work that three times their number formerly did. . . . In the chassis assembling [room] are forty-five separate operations or stations. The first men fasten four mudguard brackets to the chassis frame; the motor arrives on the tenth operation and so on in detail. Some men do only one or two small operations, others do more. The man who places a part does not fasten it—the part may not be fully in place until after several operations later. The man who puts in a bolt does not put on the nut; the man who puts on the nut does not tighten it.

                        The extreme division of labor found on the assembly line was paralleled by an unrelenting tempo of work and the absence of any control over it by the workers. Until recent efforts at “job enlargement” began to change the nature of automobile production, manufacturing methods followed the Ford pattern closely. With the typical automobile assembly line churning out 50 to 60 vehicles per hour, each worker had but a few seconds to complete an operation such as mounting a shock absorber or installing a windshield. When problems arose, the worker had to make the best of a bad situation, even if it meant installing something improperly. Under these circumstances work can be little more than a rather unpleasant way of earning a living. Extracting any sense of personal fulfillment from the work performed is just about impossible.

                        In addition to controlling the pace of work through the use of the assembly line, managers also attempted to regulate work by using elaborate systems that removed all vestiges of worker control over work processes. The most significant of these was Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Management, which was briefly discussed in Chapter 2. The important thing to reiterate here is that Scientific Management stipulated the precise scheduling and organizing of work activities, and that these procedures were never to be left to the workers’ discretion. As Taylor explained his system, “Perhaps the most prominent single element in modern scientific management is the task idea. The work of every workman is fully planned out by the management at least one day in advance, and each man receives in most cases complete written instructions, describing in detail the task which he is to accomplish, as well as the means to be used in doing the work. . . . This task specifies not only what is to be done, but how it is to be done and the exact time allowed for doing it.”

                        除了通过使用装配线控制工作节奏外，管理人员还试图通过使用复杂的系统来规范工作，这些系统消除了工人对工作流程的所有控制。其中最重要的是弗雷德里克泰勒(Frederick Taylor)的科学管理，它在第 2 章中进行了简要讨论。这里要重申的重要一点是，科学管理规定了工作活动的精确安排和组织，这些程序绝不是由工人自行决定的。 正如泰勒解释他的系统，“也许现代科学管理中最突出的单一元素是任务理念。 管理人员至少提前一天对每个工人的工作进行全面计划，并且在大多数情况下，每个人都会收到完整的书面指示，详细描述他要完成的任务以及将要使用什么手段完成工作。...这项任务不仅规定了要做什么，还规定了如何完成以及允许完成的确切时间。”

                        The development of these instructions was the work of a small group of technical specialists who were not directly involved with the work being performed, for, as Taylor stipulated, “All possible brain work should be removed from the shop and centered in the planning or laying-out department.” Efficient work required unfettered control by specially trained managers, who were to be the repository of all knowledge regarding the work being done: “The managers assume . . . the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, and formulae.”

                        Many would see Taylorism as a perversion of scientific means of inquiry and a travesty of engineering practice. But repellent as it may seem to us today, the spirit of Scientific Management still lives in technologically advanced societies. The explosion of knowledge that is the driving force of our sophisticated economy can fragment the population into groups of specialized experts. This may be a natural outcome of the growth of knowledge, but it takes on a pernicious quality when specialized knowledge is the exclusive possession of one group of people who attempt to use it as a means of dominating others. Under these circumstances science and technology do not simply supply detached knowledge that is used for universal human betterment. They are used to strengthen the position of a dominant group byremoving the control over work processes from the hands of those doing the actual work.

                        Many social critics have decried the human consequences of technologies and managerial strategies that take the skill out of human labor. Others have taken a different tack, arguing that an industrial system that “de-skills” workers is doomed to failure. A great deal of contemporary industrial work, according to this perspective, requires substantial amounts of independence if it is to be done effectively. A modern factory and its constituent departments cannot be expected to hum along indefinitely like a well-oiled machine, nor can all of the jobs be precisely defined and completely subject to control from above. Breakdowns, disruptions, and normal deterioration are inevitable, and they all require prompt attention and often a fair amount of innovative ability on the part of the workers.

                        Even routine tasks often require knowledge of special quirks in the machines and work processes. This knowledge can be gained only through intimate acquaintance with the work itself; engineers cannot plan everything in advance. There are many occasions when shop-floor workers understand things better than their bosses, and their involvement in production processes may be essential to a firm’s success. This point was strongly articulated by a General Electric executive when he noted, “All of the good ideas —all of them—come from hourly workers.” Workers who have been reduced to mindless operatives may not even be able to keep the machinery going when the inevitable problems emerge. Accordingly, effective managers realize that the destruction of worker skills through mechanization and rigid centralized controls is self-defeating, for an ignorant and hostile work force means production losses as well as high costs for maintenance and direct supervision.

                        即使是日常任务，也常常需要了解机器和工作流程中的特殊怪癖。 这种知识只能通过对作品本身的亲密了解才能获得； 工程师无法提前计划一切。 在很多情况下，车间工人比他们的老板更了解事情，他们参与生产流程可能对公司的成功至关重要。 通用电气的一位高管在指出“所有的好点子——所有的点子——都来自小时工”时就明确表达了这一点。 当不可避免的问题出现时，已经沦为无脑操作工的工人甚至可能无法让机器继续运转。 因此，有效的管理者意识到，通过机械化和严格的集中控制来破坏工人技能是弄巧成拙，因为无知和敌对的劳动力意味着生产损失以及维护和直接监督的高成本。

                        A precisely programmed production process that makes use of specialized machinery while sharply separating the tasks of those who plan and those who work is possible only when the product is a standardized one. This system generated a great outpouring of mass-produced goods, but it may not be appropriate to today’s economy and society. With improvements in the overall standard of living, consumers are less willing to buy exactly the same things that their neighbors do. Instead, they have an appetite for goods and services with distinctive qualities. These cannot be produced by traditional manufacturing processes. As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has argued, rigid production technologies were appropriate only when business enterprises were “engaged in high-volume, standardized production, entailing a large number of repetitive tasks with clearly defined goals, in which almost all contingencies could be identified and covered.” In contrast, the production of nonstandardized items requires much more flexibility, making it difficult to replace human skills with machines and machine-like processes. At the same time, the continual modification and customization of products and procedures require the ongoing efforts of a variety of workers—designers, toolmakers, computer programmers, systems analysts, setup personnel, maintenance and repair staff, construction workers, and machinists, as well as personnel involved in marketing, distribution, sales, and service. All of these occupations require a fair degree of skill and on-the-job autonomy.

But when consumers continually demand new, nonstandard products, existing ways of producing things no longer make sense from an economic standpoint. Firms that cling to the old routines not only oppress their workforce, they run the risk of eventual bankruptcy.

                        At this point it can be fairly argued that a concentration on industrial work is misplaced. As was noted in the previous chapter, the number of workers in manufacturing enterprises has steadily declined in relative terms, and these workers are now a small segment of the labor force. Work on the assembly line, often considered the epitome of industrial work, in reality occupies only a tiny fraction of workers in the manufacturing sector. Due to fundamental changes in the economy, the typical worker in the United States no longer toils on some factory floor.

More workers are engaged in what the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies as “office and administrative support occupations” than any other type of work. Today, the typical workplace is not the factory but the office. Some analysts have seen this as an indication that the general occupational level has improved. Moreover, it has been argued that technological change has in many cases increased skill requirements and allowed clerical workers to take on broader responsibilities, an assertion that will be taken up in the last part of this chapter.

These technologies are especially appealing to managers like the one who stated, “I’m a great one for believing that people will really do what’s inspected and not what’s expected.” They now have at their disposal many ways to monitor their employees. As Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy have noted: “Keystroke monitoring (where the computer counts the number of keystrokes per minute), telephone accounting monitoring (where the number of phone calls per hour and the length of each call are recorded), as well as service observation (where supervisors listen in on calls), and keeping track of unplugged time (measuring time spent away from the computer) are all becoming commonplace.” To these can be added the counting of mouse clicks and the monitoring of e-mail messages, sometimes with programs that detect potentially incriminating words like “boss” and “union.” Even executive and higher-level employees are not immune; laptop computers, cell phones, and voice mail all can keep employees tethered to an “electronic leash” that can make work a 24/7 obligation.

                        Industries and organizations, as well as the workers who are employed by them, vary immensely, making it impossible to come to a summary judgment of the consequences of technological change for white-collar work. Twenty-first-century technologies offer expanded opportunities for monitoring workers, but they also have the potential to empower these workers by making available vast troves of information that used to be available only to upper-echelon managers. It is also important to keep in mind that ascribed characteristics of workers, such as their gender and ethnicity, can affect the way in which technological changes have altered their jobs. There is some evidence that early examples of office automation were more beneficial to male rather than to female workers. In the insurance industry, for example, high-level positions in the management of electronic data processing systems became almost exclusively male preserves, while routine clerical work became an increasingly female occupation. A similar pattern was observed in the Internal Revenue Service, where computerization reduced the number of middle-level jobs, thereby blocking advancement opportunities for a largely female clerical staff. These examples indicate that when a labor market is already segmented along gender or ethnic lines, new technologies can reflect or even reinforce existing divisions. One group may benefit from new ways of doing things, while another group may find themselves in the same, or possibly worse, circumstances.

                        行业和组织，以及他们所雇用的工人千差万别，因此无法对技术变革对白领工作的影响做出简要判断。二十一世纪的技术为监控工人提供了更多的机会，但它们也有可能通过提供过去只有上层管理人员才能获得的大量信息来增强这些工人的能力。同样重要的是要记住，归因于工人的个人特征，例如他们的性别和种族，会影响技术变革改变他们工作的方式。有证据表明，办公自动化的早期例子对男性员工比对女性员工更有利。例如，在保险行业，电子数据处理系统管理中的高级职位几乎完全由男性担任，而日常文书工作则越来越多地成为女性职业。在国税局也观察到类似的模式，计算机化减少了中层工作的数量，从而阻碍了主要为女性文员的晋升机会。这些例子表明，当劳动力市场已经按照性别或种族划分时，新技术可以反映甚至加强现有的划分。一个群体可能会从新的做事方式中受益，而另一个群体可能会发现自己处于相同甚至可能更糟的环境中。

Known as “telecommuting” or “telework,” this mode of labor has grown in recent years. In 2010, more than 34 million American workers—24.4 percent of employed workers—at least occasionally did employment-related work at home.

As we have seen, domestic production prior to industrialization was riddled with problems of motivation and discipline that were ultimately overcome by the development of the centralized factory and its regimen of close supervision. Modern communication technologies have allowed some reversal of this long-term trend. Through telework, workers can avoid expensive, stressful commutes and have more on-the-job flexibility.

                        Union opposition to telework has softened in recent years with the realization that telework can be beneficial for many workers. Abundant possibilities for exploitation exist when workers are isolated in their individual homes, are dependent on their employers for their livelihoods, and can be easily replaced, but not all work in the “electronic cottage” conforms to this model. Electronic homework need not be confined to such things as routine word-processing tasks. Jobs requiring a high degree of skill and expertise can also be done in the home. It may even be possible for many specialized services to be supplied by homeworkers who are not employees of a firm but work on a contract basis, perhaps as a member of an autonomous teleworkers’ association. At the same time, regular employees who work far from their firm’s central office may not have to be electronically supervised as long as they have a personal stake in the success of the firm. This is more likely to happen when employees occupy upper-level positions within an organization. For these workers, new technologies can make their work more autonomous, convenient, and fulfilling.

                        近年来，随着意识到远程工作对许多工人有益，工会对远程工作的反对态度有所缓和。当工人被孤立在各自的家中，依赖雇主谋生，并且很容易被替代时，存在大量剥削的可能性，但并非“电子小屋”中的所有工作都符合这种模式。电子作业不必局限于诸如常规文字处理任务之类的事情。需要高技能和专业知识的工作也可以在家中完成。许多专业服务甚至有可能由不是公司雇员而是在合同基础上工作的家庭工人提供，也许作为自主远程工作者协会的成员。同时，在远离公司中央办公室工作的正式员工可能不必受到电子监管，只要他们对公司的成功有个人利害关系。当员工在组织内担任高层职位时，这种情况更有可能发生。对于这些工人来说，新技术可以使他们的工作更加自主、方便和充实。

                        Although telework can bring a number of benefits, workers should understand that a prolonged period of absence from a central workplace, even if it does not result in diminished output, may put these workers at a disadvantage when it comes to pay raises, promotions, and assignment to new projects. Teleworkers may be cut off from vital information, have difficulties forming job-related relationships with other workers, and may be excluded from essential job-related networks. As Joel Mokyr has noted of conventional working relationships, “Proximity in a plant or office created personal familiarity and thus conditions of trust and believability. There is always a role of body language, intonation, and general demeanor in human communications.”In sum, electronic communications technologies can be used for many work-related purposes, but they cannot completely replace “face time” at a workplace.

                        Optimistic students of technological change are fond of pointing out that as computerized processes continue to emerge, a growing segment of the labor force will be found in jobs that require high degrees of skill. Instead of monotonously tightening nuts and bolts or engaging in routine clerical operations, large numbers of workers will be engaged in tasks that cannot be performed by computers. Frank Levy and Richard Murnane have called attention to the many kinds of work activities that cannot be reduced to computer-friendly routines, the abilities and processes that they have dubbed “expert thinking” and “complex communication.” And, as we saw in the previous chapter, even where computers have taken hold, a large number of employees will be required to continually modify organizational structures and operations in order to make optimal use of computer-based technologies. From these perspectives, occupational skill levels are going up, and the unskilled factory operative and office clerk are becoming an anachronism in twenty-first-century enterprises.

                        It is undeniable that these trends can be found in many firms, but to less optimistic observers, predictions of the radical upgrading of workers’ tasks are at best premature. Plenty of jobs still require only the most minimal levels of skill and training. The task of monitoring industrial processes can be just as dull as the most routine assembly operation, and in any event, many of these functions can be performed by sensors connected to computers. Even maintenance and repair jobs may represent only a slight improvement in required skill levels. Technological advances can lower maintenance requirements, and when repairs need to be done, they can often be accomplished by simply disconnecting a faulty module and replacing it with a new one. The task of diagnosis, which often requires the greatest amount of the repairperson’s skills, has itself been simplified through the development of special test circuits and computer-based “expert systems.” To be sure, the need for repair skills will always be present, and it is unlikely that technological developments will allow the elimination of repair personnel. Still, any dilution of the repairperson’s skill will have significant consequences for the overall skill levels of the labor force, for these workers comprise the largest single group of skilled workers.

                        不可否认，这些趋势可以在许多公司中找到，但对于不太乐观的观察者来说，对工人任务的彻底升级的预测充其量还为时过早。许多工作仍然只需要最低水平的技能和培训。监控工业过程的任务可能与最常规的装配操作一样枯燥，而且无论如何，其中许多功能都可以通过连接到计算机的传感器来执行。即使是维护和维修工作也可能只代表所需技能水平的轻微提高。技术进步可以降低维护要求，当需要进行维修时，通常只需断开故障模块并更换新模块即可完成。诊断任务通常需要大量维修人员的技能，而通过特殊测试电路和基于计算机的“专家系统”的开发，诊断任务本身得到了简化。可以肯定的是，对维修技能的需求将始终存在，而且技术的发展不太可能消除维修人员。尽管如此，维修人员技能的任何稀释都会对劳动力的整体技能水平产生重大影响，因为这些工人是最大的单一技术工人群体。

                        Moreover, even if the optimists are largely correct, their predictions only hold for industries that make extensive use of advanced technologies. High-tech factories and offices may require higher levels of employee skills, but these are not the workplaces of large numbers of workers today or in the near future. Nor will new high-technology industries generate great numbers of new jobs. To be sure, some high-tech occupations have grown rapidly in recent years and are projected to do so in the future. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2010 to 2020 employment in “Computer and Mathematical Occupations” is expected to grow by 22 percent, for a net addition of 778,300 jobs. This represents a healthy rate of growth, but it is more than matched by the 1,443,000 projected new jobs for “Healthcare Support Occupations” (about half of which are expected to be home health care aides), the 1,861,900 additional jobs in the retail trade, and 1,029,500 more jobs in “Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations” during the same period. In fact, of the 10 occupations with the largest numerical employment increases projected from 2010 to 2020, only two—registered nurses and postsecondary teachers—require much in the way of advanced training. The remainder—occupations like personal care aide, truck driver, and customer service representative—hardly represent the high-tech future. Advanced technologies have given rise to a number of occupations that have grown at a rapid rate from a low base; however, in absolute terms, most of the job growth in the near future will take place in occupations that have been around for a long time.

                        Although technological advance does not seem to be the source of large, across-the-board increases in workers’ skills, it doesn’t seem to be producing the opposite effect either. While the skill requirements in some occupations have decreased, they have increased in others, and it is likely that all of these changes have offset one another, leaving no net change one way or the other. It also may be the case that there has been a polarization of workers’ skills as skill requirements have increased in some jobs and occupations and decreased for others. For example, automobile manufacture has changed substantially as a result of the introduction of computer-controlled equipment. This, in turn, has led to changes in the skills exercised by the factory workforce; while skilled workers have experienced upgraded skill levels, the opposite has been the case for production workers. This bifurcation was not the inevitable outcome of technological change, however. The distinction between skilled and unskilled workers has always been a prominent feature in the automobile industry, and in the absence of changes in organizational structure and culture, the introduction of new production technologies reinforced this division by giving skilled workers most of the responsibilities for the operation, maintenance, and repair of technologically sophisticated equipment while leaving ordinary production workers with jobs that continued to require little in the way of skill.

                        尽管技术进步似乎并不是工人技能大幅提高的源泉，但它似乎也没有产生相反的效果。虽然某些职业的技能要求有所降低，但其他职业的技能要求却有所增加，而且所有这些变化很可能相互抵消，并没有留下任何净变化。由于某些工作和职业的技能要求有所提高，而另一些工作和职业的技能要求有所降低，因此也可能出现工人技能两极分化的情况。例如，由于引入了计算机控制设备，汽车制造发生了重大变化。这反过来又导致工厂劳动力所运用的技能发生变化；虽然熟练工人的技能水平有所提升，但生产工人的情况恰恰相反。然而，这种分歧并不是技术变革的必然结果。技术工人和非技术工人的区分一直是汽车行业的一个突出特点，在组织结构和文化没有变化的情况下，新生产技术的引进使技术工人承担了操作、维护和修理技术先进设备的大部分责任，同时让普通生产工人从事对技能要求很少的工作，从而加强了这种划分。

                        This is hardly an atypical pattern. As several researchers have noted, organizational patterns strongly influence the skills used by workers. One aspect of organizational structure that may strongly affect workers’ skill levels is the distribution of power. When there is a sharp division between those who manage and those who work, and when managers view their workers as hostile and unreliable, workers will be treated as replaceable parts. Their skill level will be low, and they will be controlled by centralized supervision and machine-paced work processes. By contrast, when a more democratic and egalitarian order prevails, technologies that require the initiative and commitment of workers are more likely to be selected, and workers will be given a chance to develop their skills and take their places as valued members of the organization.

Today, we are experiencing the latest phase of this ongoing revolution as the Internet, mobile phones, and social media are reshaping the ways in which we communicate with one another. But to repeat what by now should be a familiar theme, these advances have been accompanied by a number of new issues and problems. The same free flow of information that enhances our ability to communicate also gives rise to concerns about the protection of information that we do not want to move so freely, such as intellectual property and personal data, about unequal access to information exacerbating the gap between the haves and have-nots, as in the “digital divide,” and about the difficulty and expense of filtering, managing, and using so much information. This chapter traces the development of digital communication technologies and the challenges they pose, and shows how technological advances can move along unanticipated paths.

                        The Internet can be described as a giant network of smaller computer networks that allow users to access files located anywhere within these individual networks. These files can be e-mail messages, Web pages, YouTube videos, and social networking updates, to name the most prominent. As with many technologies, the invention of the digital network that eventually evolved into today’s Internet began with the needs of the military. The sponsoring agency for the development of the first computer network was the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), hence the name of the first computer network, ARPANET. Its initial purpose was to tie together a small number of mainframe computers so that data could be uploaded and downloaded to and from any computer in the network. An important aspect of ARPANET was the division of each block of data into a number of smaller “packets.” In this way, the capacity of the network could be maximized by sending each packet over the route that was least congested at the time. This technique had the additional virtue of ensuring that messages would go through even if some routes were destroyed by an enemy attack, although this was not its primary purpose. The use of ARPANET for computer-to-computer communication began in 1969 when a team at UCLA attempted to transmit data by connecting their computer to one at Stanford University. The first transmission, the command to “LOG IN,” failed when the computer crashed at “G.” The network was intended to be used for the transfer of data, but before long researchers were using it to communicate with researchers at other sites. Not all of these communications were serious; jokes and idle chatter were a significant portion of ARPANET communication. By the early 1970s the sending of digitized messages, which became known as electronic mail or simply e-mail, constituted three-quarters of ARPANET’s traffic, a function that had not been considered when ARPANET was first established. In this sense, the network was a social construction, one that resulted from its users taking it well beyond its intended purpose. This was not a unique occurrence; as we have seen before, technologies created for one purpose can end up being used for something quite different, as when radio mutated from wireless telegraphy into commercial broadcasting.

                        互联网可以被描述为一个由小型计算机网络组成的巨大网络，它允许用户访问位于这些单独网络中任何地方的文件。这些文件可以是电子邮件消息、网页、YouTube 视频和社交网络更新，其中最突出的就是这些文件。与许多技术一样，最终演变为今天互联网的数字网络的发明始于军队的需求。开发第一个计算机网络的赞助机构是美国国防部高级研究计划局 (DARPA)，因此第一个计算机网络的名称为 ARPANET。它的最初目的是将少量大型计算机连接在一起，以便可以向网络中的任何计算机上传和下载数据。 ARPANET 的一个重要特点是将每个数据块划分为多个较小的“数据包”。通过这种方式，可以通过在当时最不拥挤的路由上发送每个数据包来最大化网络的容量。这种技术还有一个额外的优点，即即使某些路线被敌人的攻击摧毁，也能确保消息通过，尽管这不是它的主要目的。 ARPANET 用于计算机到计算机通信始于 1969 年，当时加州大学洛杉矶分校的一个团队试图通过将他们的计算机连接到斯坦福大学的计算机来传输数据。首次传输，即发送“登录”指令，当计算机在“G”处崩溃时失败。该网络旨在用于传输数据，但不久研究人员就开始使用它与其他站点的研究人员进行交流。 并非所有这些交流都是认真的。 笑话和闲聊是 ARPANET 通信的重要组成部分。 到 1970 年代初，数字化消息的发送（后来被称为电子邮件或简称为电子邮件）构成了阿帕网流量的四分之三，这一功能在阿帕网首次建立时并未考虑过。 从这个意义上说，网络是一种社会结构，它是由于其用户远远超出其预期目的而产生的。 这不是一个独特的事件。 正如我们之前所见，为一个目的而创建的技术最终可能会被用于完全不同的事情，例如无线电从无线电报转变为商业广播。

                        Computer networking remained largely in the military realm in the 1970s; by the end of the decade, only 16 nodes were on university campuses, while the remaining 46 belonged to members of the defense establishment. But the appeal of networked computing stimulated the development of alternative systems. Responding to growing demand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) provided financial sponsorship for the Computer Science Network (CSNET), which went into operation in 1982, offering networking at a considerably lower cost than the $100,000 annual expense of an ARPANET hookup. The NSF also created a “backbone” in 1985 to link its five supercomputing centers and to connect with CSNET and some elements of ARPANET, which had been supplanted by an exclusively military network in 1983. Computer networks expanded throughout the 1980s, facilitated by the development of programs for the efficient routing of digitized information, notably TCP (Transmission Control Program). It was during this period that the power and utility of the Internet were given a massive boost when programmers began to build systems that allowed users to access other network sites by clicking on the highlighted text or an icon that appeared on the on-screen document. By clicking on these links users could easily move all over the Internet as they accessed related text, image, and sound files. The first of these networks were proprietary, and to be included required the payment of a fee. A different approach was taken by Tim Berners-Lee at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known by its French acronym, CERN), who was the primary developer of another software system for accessing files within computer networks. Known as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), it was released in 1991 and formed the basis of a network that Berners-Lee called the World Wide Web (WWW). Two years later, the WWW team announced that they had made a crucial decision; CERN would not attempt to patent or claim any copyright fees for the technology underlying the Web. This meant that there would be no restrictions on becoming part of the Web, and as a result, it became a virtually universal repository of computer-based information and entertainment. The Web underwent explosive growth in the years that followed. In December 1993 there were 623 websites; by the end of 2011, the Web contained about 555 million sites, with hundreds more being added every day. The growth of the Web was paralleled by the growth of the Internet as a whole. By 2012 about one-third of the world’s population was “netizens.” But as we shall see, worldwide Internet usage is very unevenly distributed, with high rates of usage in some places offset by very low rates in others. The revolutionary changes wrought by the Internet reflect rapid advances in the development of computer hardware and software. But as has been noted earlier, large-scale changes are not just the product of solitary inventions. Rather, they entail the prior existence or creation of complementary elements. This is particularly evident when we consider the use of the Internet for the buying and selling of goods—e-commerce, as it has come to be called. Computers and computer networks have stimulated the emergence of a new kind of shopping by providing access to digital catalogs and allowing customers to place orders by clicking a few onscreen buttons. But the Internet and computers to access it are not enough; online buying also requires credit or debit cards and the security measures employed to protect the customers using them. For sellers, successful e-commerce depends on the use of barcode readers for selecting and keeping track of items, forklifts for retrieving them from high shelves, and conveyor belts to move them to the packing room. The transport of these items to the customers who ordered them is usually performed by nothing more avant-garde than a delivery truck, often in the service of the venerable U.S. Postal Service. In sum, the Internet has brought substantial changes to retailing, but much more has been required than sophisticated computers and software.

                        计算机网络在 1970 年代主要保留在军事领域。到世纪末，只有 16 个节点位于大学校园内，其余 46 个节点属于国防机构成员。但是网络计算的吸引力刺激了替代系统的发展。为响应不断增长的需求，美国国家科学基金会 (NSF) 为 1982 年投入运营的计算机科学网络 (CSNET) 提供了资金支持，以比每年 100,000 美元的 ARPANET 连接费用低得多的成本提供网络。 NSF 还在 1985 年创建了一个“骨干网”来连接它的五个超级计算中心，并连接 CSNET 和 ARPANET 的一些元素，这些元素在 1983 年被一个专门的军事网络所取代。 计算机网络在整个 1980 年代得到了发展，促进了发展用于有效路由数字化信息的程序，特别是 TCP（传输控制程序）。正是在此期间，当程序员开始构建允许用户通过单击屏幕文档上突出显示的文本或图标来访问其他网站的系统时，Internet 的力量和实用性得到了巨大的提升。通过单击这些链接，用户可以在访问相关文本、图像和声音文件时轻松地在 Internet 上移动。这些网络中的第一个是专有的，并且需要支付费用才能被包括在内。欧洲核研究组织（以法语首字母缩写为 CERN）的 Tim Berners-Lee 采取了不同的方法，他是另一个用于访问计算机网络中文件的软件系统的主要开发人员。此系统称为超文本传输​​协议 (HTTP)，于 1991 年发布，形成了伯纳斯-李称为万维网 (WWW) 的网络的基础。两年后，WWW 团队宣布他们做出了一个至关重要的决定； CERN 不会尝试为 Web 底层技术申请专利或索取任何版权费。这意味着成为 Web 的一部分将没有任何限制，因此，它实际上成为了基于计算机的信息和娱乐的通用存储库。在随后的几年中，Web 经历了爆炸性的增长。 1993年12月有623个网站；到 2011 年底，Web 包含大约 5.55 亿个站点，并且每天都会增加数百个站点。 Web 的发展与整个互联网的发展同步。到 2012 年，全球约有三分之一的人口是“网民”。但正如我们将看到的，全球互联网使用分布非常不均匀，某些地方的使用率很高，而另一些地方的使用率很低。互联网带来的革命性变化反映了计算机硬件和软件发展的快速进步。但正如前面所指出的，大规模的变化不仅仅是单独发明的产物。相反，它们需要与之互补的元素的事先存在或后续创造。当我们考虑使用互联网买卖商品时，这一点尤其明显——它现在已被称为电子商务。计算机和计算机网络通过提供对数字目录的访问并允许客户通过点击几个屏幕按钮下订单，刺激了一种新型购物的出现。 但互联网和计算机访问它是不够的； 在线购买还需要信用卡或借记卡以及用于保护使用它们的客户的安全措施。 对于卖家而言，成功的电子商务取决于使用条码阅读器选择和跟踪商品，使用叉车从高架上取回商品，以及使用传送带将商品运送到包装室。 将这些物品运送给订购它们的客户通常是由送货卡车执行的，通常为着名的美国邮政服务提供服务。 总而言之，互联网给零售业带来了巨大的变化，但需要的不仅仅是复杂的计算机和软件。

                        As with all significant technological innovations, the Internet has been beset by challenges and conflicts. One major issue is “net neutrality,” the expectation that every Internet site will be accessible, irrespective of which Internet service provider (ISP) is providing the access. Without net neutrality, an ISP could enable access to its chosen sites while restricting access to those of its competitors. This is particularly blatant when it is practiced by countries that attempt to block access to sites that their governments view as threats to their power and authority. It also has emerged as an issue in the United States where private-sector ISPs have been accused of giving preferential treatment to allied TV services over other providers.

                        与所有重要的技术创新一样，互联网一直受到挑战和冲突的困扰。 一个主要问题是“网络中立性”，即无论哪个互联网服务提供商 (ISP) 提供访问权限，都可以访问每个互联网站点。 如果没有网络中立性，ISP 可以允许访问其选择的站点，同时限制对其竞争对手的访问。 当国家试图阻止访问其政府认为对其权力和权威构成威胁的网站时，这种做法尤其明显。 在美国，它也已成为一个问题，私营部门的 ISP 被指控向联合电视服务提供优于其他提供商的优惠待遇。

                        Another restriction on complete access to the Internet may be self-imposed. This occurs when users confine most of their Internet usage to what have been called “walled gardens.” Selective Internet access began when providers like America Online offered an easy route to Internet sites. Today, Apple, Facebook, and Google serve as portals to the Internet for many users, while at the same time retaining some degree of control over access. This is particularly evident with Google searches that provide links in accordance with the user’s search history. Although perhaps convenient, this practice may result in someone with a perceived political orientation being initially presented with links to sites that are in accord with this orientation. This is analogous to what has been termed “narrowcasting,” the tailoring of radio and television programming to fit the interests and beliefs of specific audience segments.

                        对完全访问互联网的另一个限制可能是自我强加的。 当用户将大部分互联网使用限制在所谓的“围墙花园”中时，就会发生这种情况。 当美国在线等提供商提供了一条通往互联网站点的简单途径时，选择性互联网接入就开始了。 今天，苹果、Facebook 和谷歌作为许多用户的互联网门户，同时保留了对访问的某种程度的控制。 这在根据用户的搜索历史提供链接的 Google 搜索中尤为明显。 尽管可能很方便，但这种做法可能会导致最初向具有政治倾向的人提供指向符合该倾向的网站的链接。 这类似于所谓的“窄播”，即根据特定受众群体的兴趣和信仰量身定制广播和电视节目。

                        The use of computer-to-computer communication has spread at warp speed since the first message was sent in 1969; by 2011 there were 3.146 billion e-mail accounts worldwide, and every day three billion messages traveled through cyberspace.The rapid expansion of e-mail communication is a prime example of the “network effect.” This simply means that an interconnected system becomes increasingly valuable as more members are connected to it. A telephone, computer, or any kind of communication device would be of limited use if it were connected to only a few dozen similar devices. But anyone with an e-mail account has the potential to connect with more than three billion other e-mail users, A network also illustrates the power of positive feedback; as a network expands it becomes of greater potential value to people and organizations still outside the network. This motivates them to join the network, which makes the network even more valuable, which induces more people and organizations to join it, and so it goes until a saturation point is eventually reached.

                        In the case of e-mail, the network effect is complemented by the convenience, rapidity, and accuracy of e-mail messaging. But as with all useful technologies, the consequences of widespread e-mail use are not entirely benign. Regular users are all too aware of the annoyances engendered by e-mail. One of the worst of these is spam, the unwanted appearance of messages sent by sites featuring pornography, bogus lottery results, prescription medicines of dubious origin, and fake Rolex watches. Spam filters can partly eliminate these unwanted messages, although occasionally at the cost of a valid message being blocked.

                        就电子邮件而言，网络效应与电子邮件的便利性、快速性和准确性相辅相成。 但与所有有用的技术一样，广泛使用电子邮件的后果并非完全是良性的。 普通用户都非常清楚电子邮件带来的烦恼。 其中最糟糕的一种是垃圾邮件，即色情网站发送的不受欢迎的信息、虚假彩票结果、来源可疑的处方药和假劳力士手表。 垃圾邮件过滤器可以部分消除这些不需要的邮件，但有时会以阻止有效邮件为代价。

                        Spam is one aspect of what might be termed a “reverse network effect.” Although many e-mail messages are useless, annoying, or both, many other messages have some value, but only of a very minor sort—lame jokes, the minutes of a committee that has scant relevance to one’s own job, pictures of a colleague’s dog wearing a Spiderman costume, and so on. The larger one’s network, the more messages of this sort will show up in the e-mail inbox. As a result, more and more hours are devoted to e-mail, but with little to show for much of it. The torrent of e-mail received by many users has in some cases resulted in what has been called “e-mail bankruptcy,” whereby victims of message overload have shut down their accounts and used a separate site to politely inform past senders that they will receive no response to their messages. In today’s world, the abandonment of e-mail requires an alternative means of communication, and some individuals and organizations have turned to instant messaging, videoconferencing, and social media to meet this need.

                        垃圾邮件是所谓的“反向网络效应”的一个方面。尽管许多电子邮件是无用的、烦人的，或两者兼而有之，但许多其他邮件也有一定的价值，但只是很小的一类——蹩脚的笑话、与自己工作无关的委员会会议记录、同事穿着蜘蛛侠服装的狗的照片，等等。网络越大，电子邮件收件箱中显示的此类消息就越多。结果，越来越多的时间花在电子邮件上，但几乎没有什么可展示的。许多用户收到的大量电子邮件在某些情况下导致了所谓的“电子邮件破产”，即邮件过载的受害者关闭了他们的帐户并使用单独的站点礼貌地通知过去的发件人他们将没有收到对他们消息的回复。在当今世界，放弃电子邮件需要另一种通信方式，一些个人和组织已转向即时消息、视频会议和社交媒体来满足这种需求。

                        The growth of the many components of the Internet occurred in conjunction with the widespread acquisition of personal computers that began in the early 1980s. Access expanded significantly in the early years of the twenty-first century with the appearance of the first mobile telephones capable of logging onto the Internet. In the years that followed, the rapidly expanding capabilities of these so-called smartphones have expanded to the point that their ability to send and receive telephone calls seems almost incidental to their other functions. More recently, the introduction of tablet computers such as Apple’s iPad has given their owners a larger screen and new functions. The expanded capabilities of smartphones and tablets have made them the favorite platforms for social networking, game playing, e-mail, and other Internet-based activities. In addition, the portability of these devices allows their users to do a variety of things that would be impossible or impractical with a personal computer, such as GPS navigation and paying for purchases. Their specific features aside, smartphones and tablets have ushered in a new phase of human existence, what has been called “The Age of Connection,” an era in which anyone with a telephone or an Internet account can potentially reach anyone similarly equipped almost instantaneously.

The United States has been a receptive market for these devices; by early 2012 nearly 50 percent of mobile phone users over the age of 18 were equipped with smartphones.

                        Much of the attractiveness of smartphones and tablets lies in the applications (“apps” for short) that have been developed for them, allowing their users to track their investments, receive sports scores, receive turn-by-turn driving instructions, find their cars in a parking lot, and much more. According to one survey, by the fall of 2011, 18 billion apps for the Apple iPhone had been downloaded since the firm first opened its app store in 2008. The development of these apps has become an industry in itself that collectively produces hundreds of thousands of different apps. The value of most of these apps is, however, open to question. Although vast numbers of them are available for downloading, only a few account for the majority of actual downloads. In 2011 a mere 10 apps accounted for 43 percent of the apps actually used on the Android platform, and 50 of them accounted for 61 percent.Many apps are abandoned or rarely used; a quarter of downloaded apps are tried once and then never used again, while 68 percent of owners of smartphones with apps use only five or fewer of them at least once a week.

                        Although we tend to associate twenty-first-century technologies like mobile phones with the industrially developed countries, these phones have become widespread in the poorer parts of the world. Most of them lack the features of smartphones, but they have facilitated communications while circumventing the need for a wired infrastructure. Mobile phones are used to maintain family ties for migratory workers, to apprise farmers of crop prices, and even to provide basic medical diagnoses. Some mobile phone users in Africa are even able to use their phones as mobile banks that allow them to electronically store money, transfer funds, and pay bills. Mobile phones, and smartphones especially, have been one of the most transformative technologies of the early twenty-first century. The changes they have wrought are apparent everywhere, but nowhere more so than in the poor, rural areas of the world, where half of the world’s population resides. In the space of a few years, the spread of mobile phones has made it possible to communicate with others instantaneously instead of having to walk long distances in order to do so.

                        As was noted above, more than 900 million hours each month are spent on social media in the United States. Smartphones are of particular importance for this activity; their users spend more time on social media than those who confine their digital networking to desktop computers. In some ways the dramatic increase in the number of social media sites and their members is merely the continuation of age-old social patterns. People have always sought to connect with one another—it is one of the defining characteristics of our species—but for most of human existence the ability to interact with one another and to create, join, and participate in social networks did not go beyond face-to-face interactions. As we have seen in Chapter 12, written language and printing greatly expanded the boundaries of communication, and during the last two centuries the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television stretched these boundaries even further.

                        But what has differed from old patterns is the speed at which digital communications media gained a large audience. According to a United Nations study, it took radio broadcasters 38 years to reach an audience of 50 million, while television took 13 years. For the Internet, only four years were required to assemble 50 million users. A similar trajectory can be seen in the growth of social network sites. Facebook, the most commonly used site, began with a few dozen users at Harvard University in 2004. By the end of 2011, it counted 845 million active users and$3.7 billion in revenues. At that time, 57 percent of Facebook’s active users interacted with the service on any given day. The average Facebook user spends seven hours per month on the site.

                        但与旧模式不同的是数字通信媒体获得大量受众的速度。 根据联合国的一项研究，无线电广播公司需要 38 年的时间才能达到 5000 万观众，而电视则需要 13 年。 对于互联网来说，只需要四年时间就可以聚集 5000 万用户。 在社交网站的增长中可以看到类似的轨迹。 最常用的网站 Facebook 于 2004 年在哈佛大学拥有几十个用户。到 2011 年底，它的活跃用户数达到 8.45 亿，收入为 37 亿美元。 当时，Facebook 57% 的活跃用户在任何一天都与该服务进行了互动。 Facebook 用户平均每月在该网站上花费 7 个小时。

Twitter, despite, or perhaps because, its messages (“tweets”) are limited to no more than 140 characters, has also grown at an impressive rate; founded in 2006, six years later it had 140 million users who collectively accounted for an average of 340 million tweets every day.

                        The numerical success of these and other social networking sites is impressive. Of much more potential interest, however, is their effects on society and culture in general, and on communication in particular. In contrast to firm statistics on the number of users, an accounting of social media’s influence on society and culture is necessarily speculative. The relative newness of Internet-based social networking means that definitive statements are premature and are subject to later review, but some interesting ideas and findings have emerged. On the one hand, social media and other Internet-related media such as e-mail have moved us closer to Marshall McLuhan’s “Global Village” by connecting people on the basis of interests, work relationships, and political causes rather than geographical proximity. At the same time, however, digitally mediated connections may be undermining person-to-person relationships by making it all too easy to substitute the latter for the former. As Sherry Turkle has observed, “We expect more from technology and less from one another and seem increasingly drawn to technologies that provide the illusion companionship without the demands of relationship. Always-on/always-on-you devices provide three powerful fantasies: that we will always be heard; that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; and that we never have to be alone. Indeed our new devices have turned being alone into a problem that can be solved.”

                        这些和其他社交网站在数量上的成功令人印象深刻。然而，更具潜在意义的是它们对社会和文化的总体影响，特别是对交流的影响。与关于用户数量的可靠统计数据相反，对社交媒体对社会和文化影响的统计必然是推测性的。基于互联网的社交网络相对较新，这意味着确定性声明为时过早，需要稍后审查，但已经出现了一些有趣的想法和发现。一方面，社交媒体和其他与互联网相关的媒体（例如电子邮件）通过基于兴趣、工作关系和政治原因而非地理邻近性将人们联系起来，使我们更接近马歇尔·麦克卢汉(Marshall McLuhan)的“地球村”。然而，与此同时，以数字为媒介的联系可能会破坏人与人之间的关系，因为后者很容易取代前者。正如雪莉·特克尔 (Sherry Turkle) 所观察到的那样，“我们对技术的期望更高，对彼此的期望更低，而且似乎越来越被那些提供幻觉陪伴而不需要关系的技术所吸引。永远在线/永远在线的设备提供了三个强大的幻想：我们将永远被听到；我们可以把注意力放在任何我们想要的地方；我们永远不必孤单。事实上，我们的新设备已经变成了一个可以解决的问题。”

                        This is a powerful indictment of digitally based relationships, but other studies have found that an expansion of online relationships has not in fact led to a decline of traditional, face-to-face interactions or displaced traditional, nondigitized social relationships. Moreover, while involvement with social media sites absorbs a fair amount of time, it does not come at the expense of traditional face-to-face contacts. If anything is displaced, it is the time spent eating, sleeping, and watching television. All in all, the effects of digitally based social media seems remarkably similar to those in the early days of the telephone; despite widespread concerns at the time, chatting on the phone did not displace traditional modes of communication and socialization, If anything, telephone communications appear to have extended and intensified existing social relationships.

                        Social networks can promote stability within a society by forging and strengthening linkages between individuals. At the same time, however, they can be powerful tools for undermining an existing social order. Turning individual grievances into a mass movement requires communication links to create a sense of common purpose, to forge a group identity, to inform participants of intended actions, and to schedule these actions. The power of social networks to do all of these was demonstrated in August 2011 after the death of a man who had been killed by London policemen in the course of a bungled arrest. After a day of rioting, some individuals began to use a smartphone app that made it possible to send the same message to everyone in their phone’s directory. The message was simple: it told them to congregate at a particular time and place so they could “linkup and cause havic (sic), just rob everything. Police can’t stop it.”

                        社交网络可以通过建立和加强个人之间的联系来促进社会的稳定。 然而，与此同时，它们也可能成为破坏现有社会秩序的有力工具。 将个人的不满转变为群众运动需要沟通联系，以创造共同目标感、塑造群体身份、告知参与者预期行动并安排这些行动。 2011 年 8 月，一名男子在一次粗暴的逮捕过程中被伦敦警察杀害，这证明了社交网络能够完成所有这些工作。 经过一天的骚乱，一些人开始使用智能手机应用程序，可以向手机目录中的每个人发送相同的消息。 信息很简单：它告诉他们在特定的时间和地点聚集，这样他们就可以“联手并造成灾难（原文如此），抢劫一切。 警方无法阻止。”

                        The looting conducted by the resultant flash mob was only one of many recent examples of collective action by individuals who coalesced and took action in accordance with mobile phone messages. Other mass movements energized by social media have been oriented toward political transformation rather than illegal personal enrichment. Up to now, the most far-reaching of these has been the use of social media to bring down the dictatorial regime of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt during the “Arab Spring” of 2011. At that time, hundreds of thousands of disaffected Egyptians had been regular readers of and contributors to Facebook pages that aired their grievances and motivated them to demonstrate against the government at particular times and places. Twitter feeds provided up-to-the minute information, and mobile phones served as crucial communication links during this turbulent period. For some of the insurgents, these new communication technologies have been viewed as powerful but nonviolent weapons for successfully challenging oppressive regimes and effecting political transformation. As the creator and administrator of the most influential Egyptian Facebook site put it:

Humanity will always be cursed with power-hungry people, and the rule of law and justice will not automatically flourish in all places at all times. But thanks to modern technology, participatory democracy is becoming a reality. Governments are finding it harder and harder to keep the people isolated from one another, to censor information, and to hide corruption and issue propaganda that goes unchallenged. Slowly but surely, the weapons of mass oppression are becoming extinct.

                        Might this evaluation of new communications technologies be excessively optimistic? Social networking sites and mobile phones helped to create the collective identity and actions that rocked Egypt and other parts of the world, but it is important to note that they were an enabling factor, not an independent force for change. As ever, we have to avoid invoking implicit technological determinism that would make digital media autonomous sources of political change. In Egypt and other places where users of social media challenged the existing order, grievances had long festered within a significant portion of the population. The Mubarak regime was associated with decades of corruption, political repression, a stagnant economy, and severely limited opportunities for young people. It was a tinderbox waiting for a spark, which was supplied by the self-immolation of a young vegetable seller in Tunisia. New communication technologies helped to organize and energize the movement, but they did not start or sustain it.

                        No less important, digital communication is a two-edged sword that can be a force for oppression as well as of liberation. Technologically sophisticated authoritarian regimes can tap into e-mail accounts and mine social networking sites in order to locate associates of known dissidents and to track their activities. They can also plant bogus Web pages, blogs, and videos to discredit their opponents. Also, it cannot be assumed that widespread connection to digital media will impart unity. Tweets, blogs, and instant messages are inherently decentralized communication modes, and their fragmented nature may prevent disaffected citizens from coalescing into a unified opposition movement.Even when the effective use of social media helps to foment a large-scale uprising, it is less useful for generating long-term purposive action, especially when this requires discipline, organization, and sacrifice. As Malcolm Gladwell has argued, Facebook and similar sites excel at constructing networks, but these are not permanent structures with well-defined individual responsibilities and unambiguous centers of authority. As seen by Gladwell, social networks are deficient when it comes to setting long-term goals and creating effective strategies for achieving them. The case of Egypt seems to bear out Gladwell’s critique. Mubarak and his henchmen were swept aside by a movement that involved millions of Egyptians, but after the dust had settled, the army was in control and democracy faced an uncertain future.In the broadest terms, the role of digital media in the Egypt revolution is reminiscent of the connection between printing and the Protestant reformation nearly five centuries earlier. Neither movement would have unfolded the way it did in the absence of new media, but much more has been involved than enhanced communications capabilities. Without denying their unquestioned importance in promoting social and political change, printing, social media, and mobile phones by themselves do not a revolution make.

There is no escaping the fact that games featuring violent action are an important source of revenue and profit. The most successful game of this genre, “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,” brought in $775 million on the first five days of worldwide sales. Concerns about a possible connection between violent video games and real-life violence bring us back to some of the issues voiced by critics of televised violence. As is the case with televised violence, the influence of violent video games on behavior varies according to age, gender, and other individual and social variables. Gaming preferences also differ. Not only are males more likely to be video gamers, their choice of games tends to differ from those of female players. Males are drawn to sports and action games (not all of which are violent), while their female counterparts generally prefer strategic and puzzle games, although one study found no gender differences in regard to interest in adventure games. Other studies have found that girls and women tend to play for social interaction and to form relationships. In contrast, boys and men prefer games where winning is the most important outcome.

For the majority of players, participation in violent on-screen activities may be “just a game,” but these games may catalyze aggressive and even violent acts for those who are already disposed toward this kind of behavior.

                        Today’s video games have reached impressive levels of realism, so much so that some are now being used to prepare soldiers and the police to operate in dangerous and frightening situations. It is certainly possible that graphic on-screen violence can have a stronger and more lasting effect on the players of these games. Along with the realism that they bring, video games also require a level of attention and involvement that television viewing does not require. This greater degree of participation was highlighted in a report issued in 2001 by the U.S. Surgeon General, which speculated that video games might stimulate more aggressive and violent behavior than television viewing because the player is a participant in onscreen violence and not simply a vicarious consumer of it.

                        “Speculated” is the proper term here. Despite literally thousands of studies conducted over several decades, the link between television viewing and violent behavior remains a matter of some controversy; given the much shorter history of video games, a considerable amount of methodologically sophisticated research will be required before the consequences of violent gaming are fully comprehended. These reservations aside, an interesting negative correlation between the spread of video games and society-wide violence merits our consideration. The hypothesized connection between violent behavior and violent video games is belied by a substantial decrease in the rate of violent crime in the United States and most other countries in recent decades. The reasons for the drop in violent crime have been the subject of much debate, but this trend makes it hard to argue that violent video games have triggered a wave of violence across the land.

                        “推测”是这里的恰当术语。尽管几十年来进行了数以千计的研究，但看电视与暴力行为之间的联系仍然存在一些争议。鉴于视频游戏的历史要短得多，在完全理解暴力游戏的后果之前，需要进行大量方法论上复杂的研究。撇开这些保留不谈，视频游戏的传播与全社会的暴力之间有趣的负相关值得我们考虑。近几十年来，美国和大多数其他国家的暴力犯罪率大幅下降，证明了暴力行为与暴力视频游戏之间的假设联系是错误的。暴力犯罪下降的原因一直是很多争论的主题，但这种趋势使得人们很难说暴力视频游戏在全国范围内引发了暴力浪潮。

                        It should be noted at this point that the primary victims of video games are some of the players themselves. Although the American Psychiatric Association decided that existing research did not justify including video game addiction in the most recent edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it is a problem for some individuals. Psychologists who have treated video game addiction note that the majority of their clients are young men under 30 with poor self-esteem and limited real-life social networks. They are especially drawn to role-playing games that allow them to assume a new identity as they inhabit a virtual world that is more appealing than the one in which they live. As with other addictions, video game addiction is characterized by the need to devote large amounts of time to gaming, withdrawal from other activities, and feelings of anger and depression when one is unable to play or prevented from doing so. Addiction to technology in general may be an inescapable part of modern life, but with excessive video game play, it may become self-destructive.

                        在这一点上应该注意的是，视频游戏的主要受害者是一些玩家自己。尽管美国精神病学协会认为现有的研究并不能证明在其最新版本的《精神疾病诊断和统计手册》中包括视频游戏成瘾，但这对某些人来说是个问题。治疗过电子游戏成瘾的心理学家指出，他们的大多数客户是 30 岁以下的年轻人，自尊心很差，现实生活中的社交网络有限。他们特别喜欢角色扮演游戏，当他们生活在一个比他们生活的地方更吸引人的虚拟世界中时，他们可以假设一个新的身份。与其他成瘾一样，电子游戏成瘾的特点是需要投入大量时间玩游戏、退出其他活动，以及在无法玩游戏或被阻止玩游戏时感到愤怒和沮丧。一般来说，沉迷于技术可能是现代生活中不可避免的一部分，但如果过度玩电子游戏，它可能会自我毁灭。

                        On a more positive note, some organizations have begun to experiment online with applying gaming mechanics as motivational devices in behavior change—for example, providing real or virtual rewards as a user completes a sequence of stages on the way to achieving a goal, often within a framework that encourages competition and interaction. The term used for this is “gamification,” which, according to its exponents, makes work and other activities more engaging and enjoyable.The awarding of points, badges, or other rewards for doing certain things and completing particular tasks is not a novel technique, of course; psychologists have long known that frequent feedback generally improves performance, whether it be of workers, students, or other participants. What is new about gamification is that it depends on the existence of social media and the drive for constant connectedness. Gamification also taps into a universal attribute of human culture; in virtually every kind of society, men and women and boys and girls play games of some sort. However, the extent to which human activities can be made to resemble games is open to question. The history of business strategies is replete with many examples of fads that achieve considerable popularity and influence, only to eventually fade away as their impracticality, triviality, and ineffectiveness become evident. Gamification may fall into this category, or it may flourish because its intended group of users has been involved with electronic games for much of their lives.

                        更积极的一方面是，一些组织已经开始在线试验将游戏机制作为行为改变的激励手段——例如，当用户在实现目标的过程中完成一系列阶段时，通常在鼓励竞争和互动的框架内提供真实或虚拟奖励。用于此的术语是“游戏化”，根据其倡导者的说法，它使工作和其他活动更具吸引力和乐趣。当然，为完成某些事情和完成特定任务而获得积分、徽章或其他奖励并不是一种新技术；心理学家早就知道，频繁的反馈通常会提高绩效，无论是工人、学生还是其他参与者。游戏化的新之处在于它取决于社交媒体的存在和持续连接的驱动力。游戏化还利用了人类文化的普遍属性；在几乎所有类型的社会中，男人和女人、男孩和女孩都在玩某种游戏。然而，人类活动在多大程度上可以类似于游戏是有待商榷的。商业战略的历史充满了许多流行和影响相当大的时尚例子，但最终随着它们的不切实际、琐碎和无效变得明显而逐渐消失。游戏化可能属于这一类，或者它可能会蓬勃发展，因为其目标用户群体在他们的大部分生活中都参与了电子游戏。

                        A computer or smartphone and an Internet connection are all that is needed for buying things online, staying in touch with friends through e-mail, or using social media to foment revolution. But for many people, access to cyberspace remains limited at best. The Internet has been characterized as a highly democratic system of communication because it is not under centralized control, yet it continues to reflect inequalities within and between nations. According to statistics compiled at the end of 2011, although nearly one-third of the world’s population used the Internet to some extent, vast disparities existed within different regions of the world. To take one of the starkest contrasts, 78.6 percent of North America’s residents were Internet users, but only 13.5 percent of Africa’s population had this capability. To take another example of a great disparity in internet connectivity, 95.6 percent of the population of Iceland, the country with the greatest degree of Internet penetration, used the Internet, while only 1.3 percent of Cambodians could connect to the Internet in 2010.

                        As might be expected, all of the countries with high rates of Internet usage lie within the developed world, but substantial disparities in Internet usage can be found within these countries. Numerous critics have pointed to the “digital divide” that separates people with easy access to the Internet from those with no access. In the United States, Internet access in schools is virtually universal, but the ability to access it at home has differed according to race, ethnicity, and especially social class. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 71 percent of American households had an Internet connection in late 2010. Differences of race and ethnicity are evident but not massive; 72 percent of white households had an Internet connection, while 65 percent of African American and 67 percent of Hispanic households had one. Much more significant is financial status; 93 percent of households with incomes over $100,000 were connected, far more than the 43 percent of households with incomes under $25,000. Geographical location is also significant; 70 percent of urban households have an Internet connection, whereas only 57 percent of rural households are connected.

                        The way that different groups log onto the Internet also shows some interesting differences. The growth of smartphone ownership has created a new way to access the Internet. African Americans and Latinos are slightly more likely than whites to own a smartphone (although much of this disparity is likely due to the higher average age of the white population), and they are more likely to use these devices to access the Internet. This, however, may result in the “walled garden” phenomenon whereby control by mobile carriers, which are not governed by net neutrality laws, results in more limited access to the Internet, as when content deemed “controversial or unsavory” has on occasion been blocked by mobile carriers that serve as ISPs.In a world where the ability to acquire and make use of information has taken on increasing importance, the Internet has the potential to empower people by making information more accessible than it ever has been. But the Internet is not a technological fix. As we have just seen, while the Internet has been a revolutionary technology, access to it also reflects prevailing social and economic conditions. Perhaps of equal importance, even with widespread access to the Internet there remain significant disparities in the ability to make effective use of it. In the absence of parallel social changes, the Internet may intensify rather than diminish global and national social inequalities.

                        不同群体登录互联网的方式也显示出一些有趣的差异。智能手机拥有量的增长创造了一种访问互联网的新方式。非裔美国人和拉丁裔美国人拥有智能手机的可能性略高于白人（尽管这种差异在很大程度上可能是由于白人人口的平均年龄较高），而且他们更有可能使用这些设备访问互联网。然而，这可能会导致“围墙花园”现象，即不受网络中立法管辖的移动运营商的控制导致对互联网的访问更加有限，因为有时被视为“有争议或令人讨厌”的内容被充当 ISP 的移动运营商阻止。在获取和使用信息的能力变得越来越重要的世界中，互联网有可能通过使信息比以往任何时候都更容易访问来增强人们的能力。但互联网不是技术修复。正如我们刚刚看到的，虽然互联网是一项革命性的技术，但对它的访问也反映了当时的社会和经济状况。或许同样重要的是，即使广泛访问互联网，在有效利用互联网的能力方面仍然存在重大差异。在没有平行社会变革的情况下，互联网可能会加剧而不是减少全球和国家的社会不平等。

                        One of the most contentious issues surrounding the use of computer networks has been the innocuous-sounding practice of file sharing. In this context, a file can be anything in a digital format—text, sound, or pictures. No one objects when people use the Internet to send a Christmas letter or a photograph of a new grandchild to friends and family, but a host of legal and commercial issues arise when a DVD movie or the contents of a music CD are sent to members of a file-sharing service. At the heart of the matter is intellectual property, the ownership of a product of one’s creativity, such as a novel or a musical performance. Printed works, music, and movies intended for commercial use are protected by copyrights, which prevent the unauthorized use of the material and usually require the payment of fees when they are legally used. Governments grant copyrights for the same reason that they issue patents: both are thought to stimulate creative efforts by giving individuals and firms monopoly control over their creations, and with it the chance to reap financial rewards.

                        围绕计算机网络使用最有争议的问题之一是听起来无害的文件共享。其中，文件可以是数字格式的任何内容——文本、声音或图片。当人们使用互联网向朋友和家人发送圣诞信或新孙子的照片时，没有人反对，但是当将 DVD 电影或音乐 CD 的内容发送给成员时，会出现许多法律和商业问题。 一种文件共享服务。 问题的核心是知识产权，即一个人的创造力产品的所有权，例如小说或音乐表演。 用于商业用途的印刷作品、音乐和电影受版权保护，可防止未经授权使用这些材料，并且在合法使用时通常需要支付费用。 政府授予版权的原因与他们颁发专利的原因相同：两者都被认为通过给予个人和公司对其创作的垄断控制来刺激创造性的努力，并因此有机会获得经济回报。

                        In previous decades, the development of radio, television, movies, and recorded music greatly expanded the commercial value of creative efforts. Generations of actors, artists, musicians, and others have owed their livelihoods to the media in its various forms, but more recent technologies have been more problematic, and their use has exemplified the ways in which new technologies may create winners and losers, as noted in Chapter 1. One early example is the videocassette recorder (VCR). When the VCR first came out, it was thought that its primary function would be the playing of prerecorded tapes of movies rented from video stores. But many VCR owners also used their machines to record programs that had been broadcast on commercial television. The movie industry sued the manufacturers of VCRs and videotapes, claiming copyright infringement. In a case that eventually went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, the court ruled in 1984 by a 5 to 4 margin that home recording constituted “fair use” under existing copyright laws, allowing individuals to videotape with impunity.In the late 1990s the rapid spread of computer networks presented a new challenge to existing conceptions of intellectual property, because after being compressed and digitally encoded, a musical selection could be sent to anyone with a networked computer and the requisite software. By the start of the new century, 60 million persons were sharing music that was being routed through Napster, the most prominent file-sharing service. This was done by connecting one’s computer to Napster’s network servers, which kept a list of all the music that was available on clients’ computers in the MP3 format. Napster and its clients claimed that all that was going on was the sharing of files by private parties, which constituted “fair use” under existing copyright laws. But the courts did not agree, ruling that Napster’s central database of music titles gave it primary responsibility for what was deemed illegal downloading. Napster tried to reconstitute itself as a commercial distributor of digitized music, but it failed to survive in this guise. Napster’s demise did not put an end to file sharing. New services allowed individuals to access music residing in millions of hard disks but avoided the legal problems caused by a central database through the use of the network itself to channel requests and to inform users of available music, movies, and other digitized files.

                        在过去的几十年里，广播、电视、电影和录制音乐的发展极大地扩展了创作努力的商业价值。一代又一代的演员、艺术家、音乐家和其他人将他们的生计归功于各种形式的媒体，但最近的技术问题更多，如第1章所述，它们的使用体现了新技术可能创造赢家和输家。一个早期的例子是录像机（VCR）。当 VCR 首次出现时，人们认为它的主要功能是播放从音像店租来的电影的预先录制的磁带。但许多 VCR 所有者也使用他们的机器录制商业电视上播放的节目。电影业起诉 VCR 和录像带的制造商，声称侵犯了版权。 1984 年，美国最高法院以 5 比 4 的比分裁定，家庭录音构成了现有版权法下的“合理使用”，允许个人录像而不受惩罚。 1990 年代，计算机网络的快速传播对现有的知识产权概念提出了新的挑战，因为经过压缩和数字编码后，音乐选集可以发送给任何拥有联网计算机和必要软件的人。到新世纪伊始，有 6000 万人正在共享通过 Napster（最著名的文件共享服务）传送的音乐。这是通过将一个人的计算机连接到 Napster 的网络服务器来完成的，该服务器以 MP3 格式保存了客户计算机上可用的所有音乐的列表。 Napster 及其客户声称，所发生的一切只是私人方共享文件，根据现有版权法，这构成了“合理使用”。但法院不同意，裁定 Napster 的中央音乐数据库数据库对被视为非法下载的内容负有主要责任。 Napster 试图将自己重组为数字化音乐的商业分销商，但它未能以这种伪装生存。 Napster 的消亡并没有结束文件共享。新服务允许个人访问驻留在数百万个硬盘中的音乐，但通过使用网络本身来引导请求并通知用户可用的音乐、电影和其他数字化文件，避免了由中央数据库引起的法律问题。

                        The rise of file sharing coincided with a significant drop in CD sales, but there is no agreement that this reflected a cause-and-effect relationship. As might be expected, the music industry attributed falling sales to widespread “piracy” and claimed that the very survival of the music industry depended on the suppression of unauthorized file sharing. Although the person-to-person transfer of files was a common occurrence, the industry may have overstated its impact; one methodologically sophisticated study concluded that unauthorized file sharing had only a minimal effect on CD sales.Falling CD sales, it was argued, were the result of high prices, the lack of new and interesting music, and the appeal of alternative forms of entertainment such as video games, smartphones, tablet computers, and movies on demand. The claim even was made that file sharing actually promotes CD sales by exposing potential buyers to new music and musicians, much as radio airplay has stimulated record sales for decades.In 2011 the entertainment industry attempted to regain control over its products through the introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, respectively. If enacted as laws, these bills would have penalized third-party Internet firms such as Google and Facebook for providing access to sites offering pirated material. Internet firms fought back in a number of ways, including a one-day shutdown by Wikipedia, and the bills were withdrawn. This was not the end of the story, however, and the coming years surely will see more legislative efforts to curtail online piracy.

                        文件共享的兴起与 CD 销量的显着下降同时发生，但并没有共识认为这反映了因果关系。正如所料，音乐行业将销售额下降归因于“盗版”猖獗，并称音乐行业的存亡仰赖于对未经授权的文件共享的遏制。尽管人与人之间的文件传输很常见，但该行业可能夸大了其影响；一项方法论复杂的研究得出结论，未经授权的文件共享对 CD 销售的影响很小。有人认为，CD 销量下降的原因是价格高、缺乏新鲜有趣的音乐，以及电子游戏、智能手机、平板电脑和电影点播等替代娱乐形式的吸引力。甚至有人声称文件共享实际上通过让潜在买家接触新音乐和音乐家来促进 CD 销售，就像广播播放几十年来刺激唱片销售一样。 2011 年，娱乐业试图通过引入美国众议院和参议院分别通过了《停止在线盗版法案》(SOPA) 和《保护知识产权法案》(PIPA)。如果作为法律颁布，这些法案将惩罚谷歌和 Facebook 等第三方互联网公司，因为它们提供对提供盗版材料的网站的访问。互联网公司以多种方式进行反击，包括维基百科关闭一天，这些法案被撤回。然而，这并不是故事的结局，未来几年肯定会看到更多的立法努力来遏制在线盗版。

                        Meanwhile, growing numbers of individuals are subscribing to fee-based services that allow them to stream or download music and movies without fear of legal reprisals. The services provided by iTunes, Rhapsody, Amazon, and others have been stunning commercial successes. Apple, which had pioneered the sale of downloaded music for its line of iPods, tallied its 10 billionth iTune download in early 2010. The growth of these enterprises has cut into the practice of unauthorized file sharing. After all, it doesn’t require much of a financial commitment, usually less than a dollar, to obtain a hit song. Legal streaming (which entails the one-time viewing of a movie or music) and downloading also retain a key advantage of illegal downloading—the convenience of instantly acquiring a song without having to go to a store or wait for a mail delivery. But piracy, although diminished, has not gone away, and the fate of file sharing will ultimately depend on legal decisions, corporate strategies, and consumer tastes. In the meantime, the controversy over file sharing provides a good illustration of how technological change can be intimately connected to some fundamental human concerns: freedom, money, and power.

For example, we saw in Chapter 9 that modern genetics, in addition to being the basis of new medical treatments, also can provide intimate information about individuals, everything from hitherto unknown family relationships to propensities to contract certain diseases. Such is also the case with the wired world. All of the communications technologies covered in this chapter have the potential to undermine personal privacy, sometimes seriously. As users of e-mail messages know (or should know) an e-mail message is more like a postcard than a letter. Its contents can be easily accessed and used against the sender or receiver. The use of social media and Internet search engines leaves a record that contains quite a lot of information about the user. These can create new marketing possibilities, but sometimes at the expense of individual privacy. Facebook users were outraged in 2007 when they discovered that the social networking site was tracking their activities on participating websites and reporting them to their Facebook friends.

Facebook was cited by the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 over the violation of promises to users that their privacy would be respected. This resulted in a settlement whereby Facebook agreed to a number of stipulations aimed at protecting the privacy of its users and to monitoring by the FTC of its practices for 20 years. But the fact remains that Facebook pages contain massive amounts of personal data that marketers of every description intensely covet. Reconciling Facebook’s commercial appeal with user privacy will be a difficult balancing act.

                        一项涉及数万名用户的在线请愿结束了这些做法，但社交网站用户的隐私威胁仍然存在。 该网站的主要商业吸引力之一是其页面向营销人员提供的丰富信息，但营销人员使用这些信息可能构成对个人隐私的侵犯。 Facebook 于 2011 年被联邦贸易委员会引用，因为它违反了对用户的隐私将得到尊重的承诺。这一指控最终迎来和解，Facebook 同意多项旨在保护其用户隐私的规定，并由 FTC 对其行为进行 20 年的监控。 但事实仍然是，Facebook 页面包含大量个人数据，各种描述的营销人员都非常渴望这些数据。 调和 Facebook 的商业吸引力与用户隐私将是一个艰难的平衡行为。

                        Social media are hardly the only source of assaults on privacy. Keeping private information out of the hands of marketers and others will pose continual challenges for everyone who lives in the digital era. For example, certain recently manufactured cell phones are capable of secretly recording keystrokes made when placing telephone calls and sending text messages. The recording of keystrokes, or “keylogging” as it is known, has been used by the police in a few organized crime cases, but it can also be used for clandestine eavesdropping by private parties. The emerging technology of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) gives governments, businesses, and individuals the ability to track the movements of people who have RFID tags incorporated into their passports, drivers’ licenses, credit cards, employee access badges, student ID cards, and even library cards. Word processing documents may contain hidden “metadata” such as the name of the writer and the type of computer that was used. The installation of a GPS device on a person’s car also offers new opportunities to know the whereabouts of an individual, although the U.S. Supreme Court, in the first decision regarding digital searches, ruled that such an action requires a court order. Finally, drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer many opportunities for spying on people and places. Border control agents and some police forces are beginning to use them as inexpensive substitutes for manned helicopters. It is also possible for members of the public to buy or build their own drones for a few hundred dollars.

                        社交媒体并不是侵犯隐私的唯一来源。防止私人信息落入营销人员和其他人之手，将对生活在数字时代的每个人构成持续挑战。例如，某些新近制造的手机能够秘密记录拨打电话和发送短信时的击键动作。警方在一些有组织的犯罪案件中使用了按键记录，或众所周知的“键盘记录”，但它也可以用于私人团体的秘密窃听。射频识别 (RFID) 的新兴技术使政府、企业和个人能够跟踪在护照、驾驶执照、信用卡、员工通行证、学生证和甚至借书证。文字处理文档可能包含隐藏的“元数据”，例如作者姓名和使用的计算机类型。在一个人的汽车上安装 GPS 设备也提供了了解个人下落的新机会，尽管美国最高法院在有关数字搜索的第一个裁决中裁定，此类行动需要法院命令。最后，无人机，也称为无人驾驶飞行器 (UAV)，为监视人和地方提供了许多机会。边境管制人员和一些警察部队开始使用它们作为有人驾驶直升机的廉价替代品。公众也可以花几百美元购买或建造自己的无人机。

                        One computer entrepreneur has famously claimed, “You already have zero privacy. Get over it.” It can be safely countered that this statement is not entirely true today, for there are many defenses against privacy-invading technologies. But those of a pessimistic disposition may argue that this obituary for personal privacy, while not completely applicable today, is not wrong, only premature.

                        In considering the consequences of electronic media, beginning with radio and television, and continuing with the numerous forms of digital media available today, we are left with many unresolved issues. As with other major technological changes, the electronic media have advanced in conjunction with other historical changes, making it very difficult to come to an exact reckoning of their unique contributions to culture and society. To put it slightly differently, to understand the influence of the electronic media, it is necessary to consider the larger contexts within which they emerged and diffused.

                        在考虑电子媒体的后果时，从广播和电视开始，再到当今可用的多种形式的数字媒体，我们还有许多未解决的问题。 与其他重大技术变革一样，电子媒体的进步与其他历史变革相结合，很难准确估算它们对文化和社会的独特贡献。 换句话说，要理解电子媒体的影响，有必要考虑它们出现和传播的更大背景。

                        The electronic media are only the latest in a series of technologies that have expanded our ability to communicate with one another. As human societies have expanded in size, complexity, and mobility, the need to tie them together through improved communications media has increased apace. As we have seen, visionaries described technologies that would transmit sounds and pictures over great distances long before the realization of these dreams was technically possible. Even so, as we have seen in earlier chapters, the need for something does not ensure that it eventually will be produced. The technical capacity has to be created, and individuals and organizations have to come forward with money and other resources to support it. One of the major reasons for the success of radio, television, and the Internet can be found in the solid financial support that they attracted. During its early years, radio advanced because military, governmental, and business organizations perceived its relevance to their needs. Later, the profit-making potential of radio and then television was eagerly exploited, and the market created by commercial broadcasting further stimulated technological development. More recently, the Internet began as a creation of the military, was further developed as a means of business and personal communication, and toward the end of the twentieth century emerged as a popular medium with seemingly endless commercial possibilities. In the opening years of the twenty-first century there has been a massive expansion in the products and services tied to the Internet, and we surely have not seen the last of it.

                        电子媒体只是扩展了我们彼此交流能力的一系列技术中的最新技术。随着人类社会的规模、复杂性和流动性不断扩大，通过改进的通信媒体将它们联系在一起的需求也在迅速增加。正如我们所见，远见卓识者描述了远距离传输声音和图像的技术，早在这些梦想在技术上成为可能实现之前。即便如此，正如我们在前几章中看到的，对某物的需求并不能确保它最终会被生产出来。必须建立技术能力，个人和组织必须拿出资金和其他资源来支持它。广播、电视和互联网成功的主要原因之一是它们吸引了坚实的资金支持。在早期，无线电之所以取得进步，是因为军事、政府和商业组织意识到它与他们的需求相关。后来，广播和电视的盈利潜力被急切地挖掘出来，商业广播所创造的市场进一步刺激了技术的发展。最近，互联网开始于军队的创造，进一步发展成为一种商业和个人交流的手段，并在 20 世纪末成为一种流行的媒介，具有看似无穷无尽的商业可能性。在 21 世纪初期，与互联网相关的产品和服务出现了大规模扩张，而且我们肯定还没有看到它最终的形态。

                        The electronic media have become essential features of modern life because they have helped to mitigate the disruption of stable community ties that has been a prominent feature of the modern era. Economic and social changes have produced a great deal of social and geographic mobility, as well as corresponding feelings of rootlessness. In response, first radio and then television contributed to the construction of a common culture that served as at least a partial substitute for attenuated local ties. The effects of the Internet, social media, and other digital media are less easily characterized. Whereas television and radio formerly attracted large audiences through the broadcasting of a small range of programs, cable television and some of the key products of the Internet—websites, blogs, tweets, and social networks—are engaged in “narrowcasting” that plays to a much more limited audience. The consequences of audience segmentation are still somewhat speculative, but there can be little doubt that they have contributed to the political and cultural polarization that is characteristic of our times. Although participants in social media sites may list hundreds of “friends,” a virtual community is not the same as one based on long-lasting face-to-face relationships. As we have seen, person-to-person media such as the telephone and Facebook can strengthen existing social connections, but they should not be seen as substitutes for them. The loosening of local ties has not been reversed by the spread of new media, and according to some social scientists we have become an increasingly individualized society. For many people the electronic media have filled a void by bringing information, entertainment, and new means of communication that have helped to mitigate weakened connections to family, friends, and community. These media can be characterized as “technological fixes,” and as we saw in Chapter 2, technology cannot always fix problems that are social rather than technical in nature.

                        电子媒体已成为现代生活的基本特征，因为它们有助于减轻稳定社区联系的破坏，而稳定社区联系一直是现代时代的一个突出特征。经济和社会变化产生了大量的社会和地域流动，以及相应的无根感。作为回应，首先是广播，然后是电视，为共同文化的建设做出了贡献，这种文化至少可以部分替代减弱的地方联系。互联网、社交媒体和其他数字媒体的影响不太容易描述。电视和广播以前通过播放小范围的节目来吸引大量观众，而有线电视和互联网的一些关键产品——网站、博客、推文和社交网络——则致力于“窄播”，向更有限的观众播放。受众细分的后果仍然不甚明朗，但毫无疑问，它们促成了我们时代的政治和文化两极分化。尽管社交媒体网站的参与者可能会列出数百个“朋友”，但虚拟社区与基于长期面对面关系的社区不同。 正如我们所见，电话和 Facebook 等个人对个人媒体可以加强现有的社交联系，但不应将它们视为后者的替代品。新媒体的传播并未扭转地方联系的松动，根据一些社会科学家的说法，我们已经成为一个日益个性化的社会。对于许多人来说，电子媒体通过带来信息、娱乐和新的交流方式填补了空白，这些方式有助于缓解与家人、朋友和社区的联系减弱。 这些媒体可以被描述为“技术修复”，但正如我们在第 2 章中看到的，技术不能总是解决社会问题而不是技术问题。

Large metropolitan centres such as Toronto and Vancouver have broadband systems in place that enable many residents to enjoy widespread access to broadband. Outside of major population centres many rural and remote communities, including First Nations, remain comparatively underserved. These realities demonstrate the persistence of various digital divides in Canada. “Digital divides” refer to disparities among different population groups or geographical regions in their access to broadband systems<span class="notation">(Norris, 2001)</span>.

                        However, alongside ongoing discrepancies in access to broadband, individuals, and communities across the country are working to address these challenges through innovative, locally driven initiatives. This paper contributes a theoretical discussion that situates and frames an understanding of why First Nations would want to get involved in broadband development initiatives and the significance of their activities. The “First Nations communities” we are referring to in this article are groups of people with distinct status as self-governing nations in Canada and are located in specific geographic locations, also known as reserves. While we recognize that many members of the large and growing urban First Nations population face barriers to accessing and use of broadband systems, this paper focuses on rural and remote First Nations communities and the specific digital divides they face vis-à-vis urban communities.

Proponents of a First Mile approach argue that plans to address disparities in access to and use of broadband systems are almost always designed through processes generating from centralized institutions located far from local communities. Such processes often exclude community members in network planning and implementation<span class="notation">(Ramirez, 2001; 2007)</span>. In some cases, such ‘last-mile’ approaches build on solutions flowing from metropolitan centres. The last-mile approach frames the differences between rural and urban communities as ‘problems’ or ‘shortcomings’ to be addressed by simply linking unserved communities to already-existing systems and infrastructures. In contrast, the First Mile approach argues that first and foremost, decision-making about broadband development must be grounded in and emerge from the specific needs of local communities. The broadband policy-making process then becomes an opportunity for community members to articulate and address their needs, before technical development and planning takes place. This position seeks to re-frame solutions to the ‘digital divide’ in ways that support community-based involvement, control, and ownership.

                        We suggest that the First Mile approach to broadband policy development has particular resonance for First Nations communities in rural and remote regions. To move beyond the historical context of paternalistic, colonial-derived development policies, the First Mile recognizes that First Nations communities and governments are best positioned to decide when and how they access and use newly developing technologies, including broadband systems. This position reflects statements expressed by Indigenous peoples in international fora like the World Summit on the Information Society<span class="notation">(Fiddler, 2008)</span>. It is also an important component of Indigenous-led broadband development projects in countries like Australia<span class="notation">(Hartley, 2004; Landzelius, 2006; Leclair & Warren, 2007)</span>, the United States<span class="notation">(Morris & Meinrath, 2009; Sandvig, 2012)</span>, Canada<span class="notation">(Fiser, 2010; Mignone & Henley, 2009; O’Donnell, Milliken, Chong & Walmark, 2010; T.

                        To understand the broader context in which these initiatives are taking place, it is important to outline the overall context of broadband development in Canada, with specific focus on First Nations. Canada has a long history of broadband development. In 1997, it was the only OECD country whose citizens exhibited a measureable uptake of broadband connectivity<span class="notation">(Middleton, 2010)</span>. However, many communities and individuals did not have access to these newly developing technologies, a condition typically described as the ‘digital divide’<span class="notation">(Norris, 2001)</span>. Early-stage government policies designed to bridge the digital divide focused on quantitative issues of access that aimed to increase measurable levels of ICT diffusion<span class="notation">(Unwin, 2009)</span>. This goal was supported by the technologically determinist argument that a robust ‘information society’ would ‘naturally’ develop through the provision of connectivity and information and communications technologies<span class="notation">(ICTs)</span>. Critical scholars pointed out this unreflexive approach failed to consider the qualitative, contextual factors that can aggravate the ‘digital divide’ even in the face of high levels of quantitative diffusion<span class="notation">(Schiller, 2007)</span>. These contextual factors include socio-economic inequalities between and inside nation-states that limit the abilities of individuals and communities to access and use technologies<span class="notation">(Raboy & Schtern, 2010; Shade, 2010; Wilson, 2008)</span>. For example, a diffusionist perspective that fails to develop the local expertise required to manage broadband systems can lead to the<span class="notation">(re)</span>production of dependency relationships, with local communities left reliant on external service providers<span class="notation">(Alexander, 2005; Mattlelart, 2000; Shapiro, 1999)</span>.

                        要了解这些举措发生的更广泛的背景，了解加拿大宽带发展的整体背景十分重要，尤其是关注原住民。加拿大在宽带发展方面有着悠久的历史。1997 年，该国成为第一个其公民可享受可衡量宽带连接率的经合组织国家。<span class="notation">(Middleton, 2010)</span>然而，许多社区和个人无法使用这些新兴技术，这种情况通常被描述为“数字鸿沟”<span class="notation">(Norris, 2001)</span>。旨在弥合数字鸿沟的早期政府政策侧重于接入的数量问题，旨在提高可衡量的ICT接通水平。<span class="notation">(Unwin, 2009)</span>这一目标得到了技术决定论论点的支持，即通过提供连通性以及通信技术，一个强大的“信息社会”将“自然”发展。对此采取批判态度的学者指出，即使面对高水平的定量传播，这种非反思性的方法也未能考虑可能加剧“数字鸿沟”的品质及背景因素。这些背景因素包括民族国家之间和民族国家内部的社会经济不平等，这些不平等限制了个人和社区获取和使用技术的能力。<span class="notation">(Raboy & Schtern, 2010; Shade, 2010; Wilson, 2008)</span>例如，无法发展管理宽带系统所需的本土专业知识的传播主义观点可能<span class="notation">(再次)</span>产生依赖关系，从而导致当地社区继续依赖外部服务提供商。<span class="notation">(Alexander, 2005; Mattlelart, 2000; Shapiro, 1999)</span>

                        In response to these perceived shortcomings, researchers and policy makers in Canada argued for a more holistic definition of the ‘digital divide’. These proposals sought to consider the social relations and power inequalities that exist between various stakeholders in technology development. For example, Shade<span class="notation">(2010)</span> writes: “While it is acknowledged that access to networks and services should be equitable, affordable, and ubiquitous, it is also recognized that access depends on diverse physical, technical, economic, social and cultural factors”<span class="notation">(Shade, 2010, pp.125-6; for other examples, see Clement & Shade, 2000; Howard, Busch, & Sheets, 2010)</span>. Matear, 2002; Middleton, 2010; O’Donnell et al, 2009). Norris<span class="notation">(2001)</span> offers a summary of this perspective with her three-part definition of the digital divide that includes the global divide(between industrialized and developing societies), the social divide(inside each nation), and the democratic divide(which considers issues of technological ownership, control, access and use)<span class="notation"></span>(p.4)</span>. These kinds of proposals frame ICTs as more than already-existing artefacts: they are seen as sociotechnical ensembles<span class="notation">(Bijker, 1993)</span>; an analytical approach that expands the focus beyond physical technology to also consider the broader social context of how an artefact is shaped, distributed, adopted, and used. A 2010 World Bank report applies this kind of perspective to broadband, defining it as an “interconnected, multilayered ecosystem” that includes networks, services, applications, and users<span class="notation">(Kim, Kelly & Raja, 2010, p.15)</span>. Viewed this way, broadband development policy takes on a broader focus than simple diffusion:

                        针对这些明显的缺点，加拿大的研究人员和政策制定者主张对“数字鸿沟”进行更全面的定义。这些提案试图考虑技术发展中各个利益相关者之间存在的社会关系和权力不平等。例如，Shade<span class="notation">(2010)</span> 写道：“虽然人们承认网络和服务的接入应该是公平的、负担得起的和无处不在的，但也承认接入取决于各种物理、技术、经济、社会和文化因素”。<span class="notation">（Shade，2010，第 125-6 页；其他示例，请参见 Clement & Shade，2000；Howard、Busch 和 Sheets，2010）(Matear, 2002; Middleton, 2010; O’Donnell et al, 2009)</span>。诺里斯(Norris)<span class="notation">(2001)</span>用她对数字鸿沟的三部分定义总结了这一观点，包括全球鸿沟（工业化社会和发展中社会之间）、社会鸿沟（每个国家内部）和民主鸿沟（包括技术所有权、控制、访问和使用问题）<span class="notation"></span>（第 4 页）</span>。这类提议将 ICT 定义为不仅仅是现有的人工制品：它们被视为社会技术的集合<span class="notation">(Bijker, 1993)</span>；这些提案将信息通信技术作为一种分析方法，将重点扩展到物理技术之外，还考虑了人工制品如何塑造、分布、调整和使用的更广泛的社会背景。世界银行 2010 年的一份报告将这种观点应用于宽带，将其定义为包括网络、服务、应用程序和用户在内的“相互关联的多层生态系统”<span class="notation">(Kim, Kelly & Raja, 2010, p.15)</span>。从这个角度来看，宽带发展政策比简单的传播具有更广泛的关注点：

                        In Canada, proposals have emerged to support this more holistic approach to broadband development. For example, proponents of Community Informatics argue that communities be supported to take ownership of the design and administration of broadband systems<span class="notation">(Gurstein, 2000; 2007)</span>. Gurstein<span class="notation">(2007)</span> highlights the need to design socio-technical systems that support community-based participation and control, for example through mechanisms of decentralized local governance. This perspective considers “the design of the social system in which the technology is embedded as well as the technology system in which it interacts”<span class="notation">(Gurstein, 2000, p.2)</span>. Another proposal from this perspective is Clement and Shade’s<span class="notation">(2000)</span> Access Rainbow, which includes questions about levels of digital literacy and governance alongside broadband penetration statistics. These kinds of proposals are acknowledged by Canada’s federal government in numerous policy documents<span class="notation">(see for example the CRTC, 2009; National Broadband Task Force, 2001)</span>. They also share parallels with Canada’s long history of development of large-scale communication infrastructures for telephony and satellite television. The historical development of these infrastructures received government support through subsidies and regulation, as shaped with reference to the public benefits their diffusion and use among residents could support<span class="notation">(Babe, 1990; Raboy & Shtern, 2010, p.75)</span>.

                        The next section of this paper outlines an alternative approach to connectivity policy-making articulated in the late 1990s called the ‘First Mile’. We suggest this ‘First Mile’ policy framework is useful for the specific context of First Nations broadband development in Canada, and potentially for other Indigenous peoples. The First Mile approach shares many of the same considerations as Community Informatics and the Access Rainbow, and in particular foregrounds that broadband development must emerge from, and be shaped to fit, local community contexts. However, we suggest the First Mile approach has particular resonance for Indigenous peoples. During the World Summit on the Information Society<span class="notation">(2003 to 2005)</span>, Indigenous peoples highlighted the need to balance equitable access to information and communications technologies with the need to retain their unique, locally grounded Indigenous rights, cultural identities, traditional territories and resources. Participants noted that Indigenous peoples themselves are best positioned to decide when and how they access and use new technologies such as broadband systems<span class="notation">(Aboriginal Canada Portal, 2005)</span>.

                        In short, the First Mile project in the 1990s argued the process of connectivity development in local communities must be fundamentally re-framed to support and encourage participation of community members in all stages of planning, implementation and use. It argued that the most effective, efficient connectivity designs and applications are those rooted in the specific requirements of local communities. To address the challenges of power discrepancies, differing cultural worldviews, and potential dependency on external service providers, the First Mile process sought to re-distribute decision-making power to community members, supported through interactive media technologies.

                        We suggest that a First Mile policy approach in Canada might support First Nations leadership to make decisions about broadband development for and in their communities. This approach recognizes specific differences between First Nations communities and non-Aboriginal communities in Canada. First Nations are self-governing autonomous political entities, with each First Nation responsible for providing political, social, economic, community and cultural services to its members and residents. These responsibilities are different from those of municipal governments: they are grounded in the legal and political status of First Nations as sovereign peoples with political treaty relationships with the federal government and with inherent, group differentiated rights. It is important to note the variety of interpretations and applications of self-determination and self-government by First Nations<span class="notation">(Abele, 1999; Abele & Prince, 2006; Macguire, 2008; Tully, 1999)</span>. This paper avoids commenting on the form of self-determination that individual First Nations express. However, it does recognize these political considerations are central to efforts of First Nations to secure control over broadband development. This is one reason we suggest that examples of First Mile broadband development are best examined on a case-by-case basis.

These challenges impact the ability of First Nations to secure control over policy development and service delivery. They are reflected in ongoing funding constraints, fragmented government policies, and a policy development process typically developed in centralized, urban institutional environments. Compounding these challenges, many First Nations communities have small populations and are relatively geographically isolated, with some only accessible year-round through fly-in access. Many lack roads or other infrastructure, including for broadband. We suggest that these conditions, as well as the ongoing digital divide these First Nations communities face, support arguments that broadband development policies involving Canada’s First Nations must be fundamentally transformed. Drawing on the ‘First Mile’, we argue this transformation must support policy-making grounded in and emerging from First Nations communities themselves.

                        It is important to note that the First Mile approach should not be uncritically accepted as a panacea to broadband development policy. Internally, one major challenge these communities face in achieving First Mile broadband systems is a lack of human and technical resources. It is not enough for a community to simply build local broadband infrastructure; many remote and rural First Nations communities lack the capacity to manage them. For example, some satellite-served remote communities must employ technically sophisticated bandwidth management strategies to accommodate their needs, but sometimes lack human and technical resources and expertise needed to operate them effectively<span class="notation">(O’Donnell, Simms, Walmark & Hancock, 2009)</span>. In terms of usage of these systems, there are often low levels of awareness among First Nations community members that broadband technologies are available and useful. For example, even 10 years after introducing videoconferencing equipment, in some communities people do not integrate this technology in their daily work. This is often due to a lack of basic training, high levels of staff turnover, and the lack of community engagement skills.

                        Externally, First Nations control and ownership of broadband systems is impacted by the uncertain nature of federal government funding programs<span class="notation">(McMahon et al, 2010)</span>. While government funds for public services in First Nations are guaranteed due to treaty relationships, levels of funding are often insufficient and not administered by the federal government in a manner that meets community needs. A trend over the past two decades indicates that the federal government has been converting program funding in government departments to short-term project and one-time capital funding, and therefore many social and community services lack stability<span class="notation">(Gibson, O’Donnell, & Rideout, 2007)</span>.

                        Despite these challenges to its implementation, we suggest the First Mile policy framework offers an opportunity for First Nations in Canada to secure self-determination in broadband development. Following Macguire’s<span class="notation">(2008)</span> argument that self-determination is most effectively articulated by the parties engaging in it, our tentative suggestion is that the First Mile projects underway in Canada offer examples of self-determination in action. There are many historical and contemporary examples of how Indigenous peoples around the world have struggled for greater self-determination in a variety of fields, including contemporary social movements taking place through the networks made possible through digital technologies and the Internet. We suggest that a First Mile approach offers a policy framework that supports First Nations control and ownership of community-driven broadband development. The specific forms that First Mile projects take are grounded in local communities (and/or partnerships between communities) and contingent on local contexts<span class="notation">(Thiessen & Looker, 2008)</span>. As noted several times in this paper, in-depth research of First Mile projects is at its very earliest stages. In future, as more studies with these community projects are completed, they will showcase how First Nations are planning, administering, managing and retaining ownership of the digital networks and technologies that deliver public and community services. Grouped under the paradigm of the ‘First Mile’, we propose that these projects hold potential and relevance in the international context of Indigenous self-determination in broadband development.

                        For many northern Inuit communities, the resource extraction industries may appear to be at odds with their cultural practices of sustainable and respectful use of the environment. Mining, for example, is not a sustainable industry; in the long term it is only a temporary use of the land. The environmental consequences of these industries can far outlast the lifespan of the resources being removed. There are numerous examples of closed and abandoned mines being environmental hazards for decades or even centuries. Mining and oil and gas industries may undermine traditional land use patterns and contaminate soil, water and traditional foods. Essentially, each stage of a mining project—exploration, construction, production, closing, and reclamation—holds significant opportunities as well as significant risks for nearby communities.

                        The strength and vitality of many northern cultures are linked to heritage resources like caribou. But animal population levels are declining. The boreal woodland caribou, for example, is now listed as a species at risk. There is concern about habitat destruction from oil and gas exploration, and from Arctic uranium, gold and diamond mines. Caribou populations are also threatened by over-hunting as a result of more roads and better equipment like snowmobiles, as well as increased predation from wolves, coyotes and bears. Some biologists predict that caribou herds will be under greater threat if the natural gas pipeline along the Mackenzie River is completed2. Traditional knowledge can be used to reduce the impact of pipelines and mining on caribou migrations. For example, traditional corrals may be a way to herd caribou away from mining sites during their migration.

                        In some ways, resource projects have the potential to strengthen the value of traditional knowledge. For example, development projects require environmental reviews that incorporate traditional knowledge. This necessitates the recording of traditional land use and occupancy, and can contribute to resource management planning not only during the life of the industrial project but long after it is finished. The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is becoming widespread for this type of documentation. GIS is used to map traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and other culturally important information. Traditional place names, sacred sites, traditional travelling routes, traditional food gathering areas, archaeological sites, and heritage areas can all be digitally recorded. The knowledge and wisdom of the Elders can be used to inform the planning and management of natural resources within the traditional lands. It can also be used to teach younger generations.

At first, trapping and the fur trade were important sources for money. Snowmobiles have now replaced dog teams but they require money to buy and expensive gasoline to operate. Wage employment provides money to purchase and operate equipment needed for traditional harvesting. With the decline of fur prices and the boom and bust cycle of resource exploration, the dual economy has become unstable and is now largely sustained by government employment, temporary wage employment, and social assistance payments.

                        At the community level there is tension between traditional and wage economies. Many northern communities still rely on wildlife harvesting to provide food and to reinforce cultural values such as sharing. On the other hand, some participation in the wage economy is essential to buy the equipment needed to hunt and to purchase other essential market goods. But wage earners are less likely to share their income with the family or community, and may not spend their earnings in the community in support of local businesses. This can undermine community health and wellness.

                        The potential for an improved standard of living may make employment opportunities in the resource extraction industries look very attractive to Aboriginal workers. However, the prolonged fly-in and fly-out cycle of work can put pressure on family relations and reduce opportunities for workers to provide traditional foods. On the other hand, wages may be spent on new equipment and supplies that increase the efficiency of the harvest. In this context, resource extraction projects can be seen to strengthen traditional harvesting activities. Unfortunately, with an influx of cash and a higher demand for equipment, the cost of the equipment is likely to rise— at least during the lifetime of the project. This may make it difficult for those who are not earning high wages to purchase or upgrade harvesting equipment.

Another option is to have local harvesters provide country food to the work camps. Ideally, there would also be flexible work schedules that accommodate traditional harvesting and other Aboriginal cultural, family and community needs.

                        The resource extraction industry can undermine traditional land use patterns and alter the health, quality and availability of resources. There are concerns, for example, that the proposed 1,220 kilometre pipeline for the Mackenzie Gas Project will fragment crucial wildlife habitats and migration corridors, and, in turn, affect the way of life of many Aboriginal residents. Destroyed wetlands, clear-cut forests, explosions, seismic activities, and heavy vehicles can disrupt wildlife behaviour, forcing people to travel farther to hunt. These projects also open up largely undeveloped regions to increased resource exploitation. The result may be more development and more roads, airstrips and hydro dams.

In case a company goes bankrupt, governments may require financial deposits to make sure there is enough money to clean up a site once operations stop.

                        As a rule, promoting traditional foods encourages the use of traditional knowledge while improving the health of local Aboriginal people. With the coming of industrial development, some communities say they can no longer hunt, fish, trap, or enjoy being on the land as they once did. Dene Tha’ hunters and trappers report that moose are becoming harder to find and Caribou populations are declining. The dietary health of northern communities is influenced by the level of access to traditional or country food, their dependency on southern foods, and the question of contaminants.

                        Elders state that the health of young people would improve if they ate more traditional foods and less market foods. Research has shown that the diet of Dene and Métis community members was better when they ate a combination of traditional and market foods instead of a diet comprised solely of market foods. In northern communities, southern-made market foods are limited in variety and quality, and are much more expensive due to shipping costs. Besides the lower costs and higher nutritional value of a traditional diet, country foods are a source of cultural strength, contributing to the social, mental and spiritual well-being of individuals and the entire community.

                        Northern contaminants are a complex issue that extends beyond the impact of oil, gas and mining activities. A great deal of research has been conducted into this matter—much of it financed and coordinated through the Northern Contaminants Program at Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. The general consensus is that southern contaminants transported to the Arctic through atmospheric and ocean cycles, and which accumulate in northern country foods, should not discourage the consumption of this food. Country food is healthier than a diet comprised of southern processed foods high in salt and sugar.

                        Mining activities and major construction projects are also contributing to contamination. Radioactive material, heavy metals, acids, and dirt and dust from roads and construction sites are major problems. Heavy metals like cadmium, mercury and lead, and persistent organic pollutants concentrate in the fatty tissues of Arctic animals, causing problems in their reproductive and immune systems. As they are at the top of the food chain—along with polar bears—humans are exposed to high levels of these pollutants through country food. Industrial activities also undermine access to country foods; roads, mines and pipelines are disrupting terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The quality and availability of country foods are declining.

Obesity, diabetes, increased heart disease, and other chronic diseases typically follow this shift in dietary habits. The rise in these conditions is clearly documented in the results from the Survey on Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA).

                        Though the timeframes may vary considerably between a pipeline project and a mining project, they are all short-lived. The Mackenzie Gas Project is expected to take only three years to build. This is a classic boom and bust cycle of resource exploitation. For many communities, the social changes or disruptions are expected to be short-term. The environmental consequences also may be considered short-term. As mentioned above, current regulations and legislation require that the land be returned to its original state after a project is complete. The effects on cultural continuity are more difficult to gauge. Opportunities for wage labour and money from mining royalties may contribute to the loss of traditional cultural values and undermine the social ties that bind small communities together. Projects may encourage workers from the south in search of high-paying jobs to come into the region. Their presence may disrupt a close-knit community.

But the project may still disrupt access to traditional foods that are important to cultural identity. This in turn may impact the diet and nutrition of community members. The influx of cash into the community may encourage the consumption of more southern foods, or it may provide money to buy equipment to continue harvesting traditional food—even if it is necessary to travel farther to find the wildlife.

            <div class="answer">This example shows that technological diffusion is not a one-way process; without active participation by the recipients of the foreign technology, an imported technology may end up an expensive failure. In turn, effective participation often is the product of previous efforts at indigenous technological transformation. The issue is not one of “imitation” versus “self-reliance,” but of how to achieve an effective blending of the two.</div>

            <div class="answer">
                The biggest change after the mass production of cars is increased car production and reduced car prices. These two points have led to a rapid increase in car ownership, and this has created more derivative demand: car sales, car insurance, second-hand car sales, car repairs, driving schools, parts production, parking lot development, and so on. All these industries have created employment that offset the decline in manpower demand on the automobile production line.

                If telephone calls were still manually switched as they were in the 1920s, today’s level of telephone traffic would require no fewer than 50 million operators. Jobs were lost due to the introduction of automatic telephone switching, but total employment in the telephone industry continued to rise because increased levels of demand stimulated the industry’s expansion. Equally important, the expansion of telephone communications has acted as a powerful stimulant to the economy as a whole, leading to the creation of many jobs that would not otherwise exist.

                        Through telework, workers can avoid expensive, stressful commutes and have more on-the-job flexibility. But abundant possibilities for exploitation exist when workers are isolated in their individual homes, are dependent on their employers for their livelihoods, and can be easily replaced.

                        Yes. First, centralized government programs and policies preclude the efforts of their own Aboriginal governments to secure self-determination.

                        Development projects require environmental reviews that incorporate traditional knowledge. GIS is used to map traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and other culturally important information. Traditional place names, sacred sites, traditional travelling routes, traditional food gathering areas, archaeological sites, and heritage areas can all be digitally recorded. The knowledge and wisdom of the Elders can be used to inform the planning and management of natural resources within the traditional lands. It can also be used to teach younger generations.

                        Participating in the dual economy refers to involvement in such traditional harvesting activities as hunting, fishing and gathering as well as participation in the cash economy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wage employment provides money to purchase and operate equipment needed for traditional harvesting.

                        Wage earners are less likely to share their income with the family or community, and may not spend their earnings in the community in support of local businesses. This can undermine community health and wellness.

            <div class="answer">
                Generally, governments require companies to have closure and reclamation plans before a project begins. The intent is to return the land to its pre-mining or pre-project state. In case a company goes bankrupt, governments may require financial deposits to make sure there is enough money to clean up a site once operations stop.
